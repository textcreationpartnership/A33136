            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:51478:26"/> ſhall only ſay thus much, That they were fancies which ſhew'd a wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Wit, that may perhaps be more reaſonably excus'd then defended: The vanity of Invention being an Epidemical Diſeaſe, that hath infected moſt of the Sons of <hi>Mercury</hi> in all Ages and all Nations, there being ſomething in it that looks like Piety: <hi>Nam mentiri clarorum imagines eſt aliquis vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutum amor</hi> (ſaith <hi>Pliny</hi>) which Error, whilſt ſome of our graver Authors have with no leſs affectation attempted to correct, they themſelves (like great Phyſitians in the time of great Plagues) have been overtaken with the general Infection; as that renowned Preſident of Antiquaries Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> before mentioned was, who excuſing his weaker Brethren with a <hi>Detur venia Antiquitati ut miſcendo falſa veris, &amp;c.</hi> did not ſuppoſe he had ſo prophetically apologiz'd for his own <hi>Brith-Tania;</hi> which being delivered as an Origination of Celtick and Greek, upon further inquiry proves to be no part of either Speech, at leaſt not in that ſenſe he uſes it. For taking the <hi>h</hi> out of <hi>Brith</hi> to accommodate the word (as he deſign'd) to <hi>Brittannia,</hi> it then becomes <hi>Brit,</hi> which is no word of any ſignification in the Welch Tongue, and conſequently by the razing out that ſingle Letter, all the var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh of his fancy comes off, and ſpoils the painting that lay under it. But if the principal reaſon of his leaving out the <hi>h</hi> (which might be the more excuſable in reſpect it has been taken to be an ominous letter to this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) were to make that <hi>Sybilla lingua</hi> (as he calls the Welch Tongue) more ſmooth and polite, why then did he not leave out the two <hi>it</hi>'s alſo? the continuance whereof makes his Etymology ſubject to an unanſwerable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection in point of Novelty: for that there is no ancient word any where to be found that has a double <hi>t</hi> in it, as his <hi>Brittannia</hi> has. Now if both the <hi>tt</hi>'s and the <hi>h</hi> had been omitted, it had then been <hi>Bri-tannia;</hi> which as it is leſs conſtrained, ſo it is more acceptable to every common Reader, but eſpecially to thoſe that are Natives. For that <hi>Bri, linguâ vernaculâ,</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies <hi>Honos,</hi> and ſo the name of <hi>Brittains</hi> would have implyed as much as the Honorable Nation: in which ſence I could be content to reſt my ſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out farther ſearch, if the Criticks would have allowed his <hi>Tania</hi> to have been Greek for <hi>Regio:</hi> but this being modeſtly doubted by the learned <hi>Spelman,</hi> and utterly denied by the famous <hi>Cauſabon</hi> (who took it ſo ill to have a Greek word obtruded upon him, that he never heard of before, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his excellent Epiſtles yet extant, there is one letter purpoſely, not to ſay paſſionately, written to Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> upon this ſubject, by which he requires him to prove it Greek if he could) I muſt conclude, as by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning no anſwer to that bold Challenge, I ſuppoſe he himſelf did, that it was not the leaſt of his learned miſtakes. However, the Greeks were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to him for the honour intended them: whilſt by that ſingle termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Tania,</hi> he indeavours to prove them the only Godfathers to many other great Nations, beſides this of ours: <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe of <hi>Aquitania</hi> and <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditania,</hi> no mean People: and thoſe of <hi>Luſitania</hi> yet greater; with thoſe of <hi>Mauritania</hi> and <hi>Turgitania,</hi> more famous then they: and yet there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Kingdom (which it ſeems he forgot) that could more certainly have proved their Denomination from the Greeks, that is the great Kingdom of <hi>Batania,</hi> which before the Greeks poſſeſt it, was called the Kingdom of <hi>Baſtian,</hi> in the Land of <hi>Paleſtine.</hi> Neither has he made mention of another greater perhaps then all theſe put together: to wit, that mighty Empire of the <hi>Chynenſes,</hi> who in their native Tongue call their Country <hi>Taine,</hi> which comes as near <hi>Tania</hi> in ſound as may be, but nearer yet in the ſenſe: <hi>Taine</hi> importing as much as the Realm or Region, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Great were the hopes conceiv'd of this Prince his Virtue, greater thoſe of his Fortune; whilſt being both a Chriſtian and a Chieftain of ſo high note, no man could doubt his Power that did not diſtruſt his Courage: But ſtanding ſingle and alone, like a high Tree upon a large Plain, it was not in the power of Fate to keep him from being blown down. Neither was it ſo great a wonder that he ſhould fall (being expoſed as he was to ſuch laſting Storms of Hoſtility) as that his Son <hi>VORTIMER</hi> ſhould ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>top him, who riſing like a dwarf'd Plant out of a Thicket of Brambles (for his whole Reign was as one continued Battel of twelve Years) grew ſo crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in making his way out, that it was not likely he ſhould attain to any conſiderable height; having this neceſſity added to the reſt of his unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, that by the ſame means he expected to be Great, he was obliged to be Impious: The regard he pretended to have to his Country, being ſo incompatible with that due to his Father, that nothing but his own could have prevented his Fathers death.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Vortigern</hi> foreſeeing by inſtinct of <hi>Majeſty</hi> (that is, a compound of Fear, Jea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Their Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was one <hi>Engiſt,</hi> a politick Prince, who to make his conqueſt ſure, brought along with him a fair young Daughter to be partaker of his Glory, by reducing the amorous King under her power, whiles he brought the clamorous People under his; the weakneſs of both the one and the other being ſo notoriouſly known, that he concluded him as little able to ſtand againſt her, as they to withſtand him; neither was he deceiv'd in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, the power of her Charms being ſo reſiſtleſs, that it was not long before the faſcinated King repudiated his Chriſtian Wife, to eſpouſe her that was a Pagan.</p>
               <p>This, as it aggravated the offence generally taken by his People, ſo it particularly provoked his Son <hi>Vortimer</hi> to lay aſide all obligations of Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Duty; who neither reſpecting him as a Father, not as a King, puniſh'd his ſin (ſeemingly againſt Nature as well as Reaſon) by a judgment no leſs ſtrange and inhumane, commanding that he ſhould at once be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of life and honour, by putting him into that condition, as made them equally burthenſome to him, whiles he was immured betwixt two Walls within the narrow confines of ſuch a diſmal Dungeon, as ſeeming like, was yet ſo much worſe then a Grave, as the preſent ſhame and ſcorn worſe then death.</p>
               <p>Thus he continued dying all the time of his Sons life, but he being ſlain by the <hi>Saxons,</hi> by a rare accident in the fortune of Princes, he recovered not only his Liberty, and with it his Underſtanding, but ſo far repoſſeſt himſelf of the affections of the People (who naturally incline to pity men
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:51478:53"/> in miſery, and much more their Prince) that believing him thoroughly ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of his error, and encouraged by his Example, they ſet upon the <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> unanimouſly, and began a War that every body believed wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>So fierce indeed was the execution on either ſide, that Victory delighting in miſchief, ſeem'd to hover over both Armies, as not reſolv'd which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd beſt of her. The <hi>Britains</hi> ſtrove to ſhut the door of Invaſion; the <hi>Saxons</hi> fought to keep it open; and as long as they were upon even terms, the <hi>Britains</hi> grapled deſperately with them: But the <hi>Saxons</hi> having poſſeſt themſelves of ſeveral Ports, by which they receiv'd continual recruits out of their own Country, they not only tyred out all thoſe that liv'd neareſt the danger, but (which was yet more dangerous) by picking one Arrow out of the Sheaf, hazarded the falling out of all the reſt: for the gaining <hi>Kent</hi> made their way into <hi>Suſſex,</hi> the poſſeſſion of that gave them admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into <hi>Suffolk</hi> and <hi>Norfolk;</hi> the loſs of thoſe loſt the North: And in the end <hi>Vortigern</hi> too late finding how he was involved in the miſery of his own folly, not more confounded with ſorrow then ſhame, retired firſt into <hi>Cornwall,</hi> after into <hi>Wales,</hi> where he dyed as unpitied as he was miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>

               <p>This extremity beat <hi>Vortigern</hi> off from his firſt confidence, and morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied him ſo far, that he was content to give up a third part of his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that he might quietly enjoy the reſt. But as the pouring Water upon Fire, if it do not utterly quench, raiſes the flame higher; ſo what he gave, contributed ſo little to the ſatisfaction of their Avarice, and ſo much leſs to that of their Ambition, that it ſerv'd only to increaſe their deſire of having more; and to draw them on from one Propoſal to another, till they had ſo far waſted and weakened him in Reputation and Power, that another Enemy ſeemingly leſs conſiderable, was emboldened to put in his claim for the reſt. This was the preſent King, who being a Prince of the ſame ſtock, I cannot ſay of the ſame temper, juſtled him out of the Throne at the firſt ſhock, and finding him reeling, preſt ſo hard upon him, that his fall made a greater noyſe then his riſe.</p>
               <p>With this <hi>Aurelius Ambroſius</hi> came over his Brother <hi>Uter,</hi> a Prince very early in action, and for his fierceneſs ſirnamed <hi>Pendragon:</hi> to theſe the People as willingly opened their Purſes as their Ports; ſo that like two young Eagles, being upon the wing, they took their ſlight ſeveral wayes, each to prey for himſelf, where ere they could find their Quarry. <hi>Ambro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> ſet upon the <hi>Saxons,</hi> whiles <hi>Uter</hi> ſought out <hi>Vortigern.</hi> This brought a fourth pretender into the liſt, as forward and fortunate as either of them: who had he been as skilful to keep, as he was to get a Victory, he might poſſibly by turning Fortune round, have made her ſo giddy, that ſhe could not in a ſhort time have been able to bear up as after ſhe did, and fix her ſelf upon one ſide: This was <hi>Paſcentius</hi> the ſecond Son of <hi>Vortigern,</hi> who mov'd with like Zeal to preſerve his Father, as his elder Brother was to preſerve his Country, joyned with the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and ſet upon <hi>Ambroſius,</hi> to divert <hi>Uter,</hi> and if poſſible, to have contracted the War into a narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er room, at that place now called <hi>Aymesbury,</hi> but in the firſt place <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſebury,</hi> in memory of K. <hi>Ambroſius</hi> his being ſlain there, where they met with ſo like aſſurance, and not unlike courage, that the hopes on either ſide ſeem'd evenly poys'd: But the Battel ending with the lives of the two great Undertakers, <hi>Ambroſius</hi> and <hi>Paſcentius,</hi> the one juſt ready to ſtep into the Throne, the other not well fixed in it; who went into the other World, with a ſufficient train of Followers to ſhew what rank they held in this. <hi>Uter</hi> enter'd not only without reſiſtance, but without a Rival, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded no leſs to his Greatneſs then to his Security.</p>

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:51478:59"/> power of Majeſty was ſo checkt, that though there were ſome one or other all the time of the Heptarchy, who for dignity ſake had the Prerogative to be ſtil'd <hi>Rex Anglorum,</hi> (which was no leſs than <hi>Rex Regum</hi> at that time) as much as to ſay, King of all the reſt of the Kings, yet not any one of theſe Monarchs were able to effect any ſuch entire Conſociation for the ſecurity of the whole, as to ſettle any one form or order of Law currant amongſt them, till <hi>Alfrid (more Majorum)</hi> after the cuſtom of his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, the <hi>Germans,</hi> did (as <hi>Tacitus</hi> teſtifies of them) <hi>Jura per Pagos red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere,</hi> every County till his time, holding their Cuſtoms apart, as they had receiv'd from thoſe <hi>Roytelets,</hi> their particular Founders, without the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to any univerſal Law but what was Canonical; which was not the leaſt cauſe they labour'd ſo long in vain, under the various preſſures of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, neceſſity and chance, being driven to and fro like the Sea, from whence they firſt came, (the nature of which reſtleſs Element is to loſe ground in one place as it gets in another) and urg'd with alternate Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, after they had loſt all their Intereſt in their own Countrey, to be in hazard of being irrecoverably loſt here, whilſt they were forc'd to maintain a War againſt the <hi>Britains,</hi> their common Foe, the <hi>Danes,</hi> their accidental Foe, and themſelves, the inteſtine Foe, and therefore the moſt dangerous, by how much they themſelves made the breach, at which the other entred, who watching his time (as the <hi>Ichnewmon</hi> that creeps into the mouth of the <hi>Crocodile,</hi> whilſt he is gaping to devour his prey) made a paſſage through their bowels, before they could ſwallow up the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi> and gain an entire conqueſt over them.</p>
               <p>This lookt like a judgment inflicted upon them, by that <hi>Nemeſis,</hi> that was the juſt revenger of the <hi>Britains</hi> wrongs; to whom they were of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the moſt pernicious enemies; for contrary to the practice and policy of thoſe that were before them, as well as of thoſe that came after them, they refus'd all commerce, communion, or mixture with them, extinguiſht their Religion totally, ſilenc'd their Laws, rejected their Language, and in concluſion took from them their very Name, as well as their Countrey. Neither ſtopt they here, but diſſolving all regard, rendred Barbariſm wholly triumphant, whilſt fury and ignorance met in conjunction. In fine, being irreconcileable to whatever could be call'd civil or ſacred, they not only took from the Men their Lives, from the Women their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, from both their Liberty, but defac'd all Monuments, devoted to pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety or peace; and if they did not wholly demoliſh them, yet they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan'd the holy things, not ſeldom ſacrificing the Sacrificers upon their own Altar. And which made the Perſecution the more dreadful, was, that it was not to be pacified by any Offering or prayers, for one hundred and fifty years together, ſo far as to have the leaſt regard to Sex, Age, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, Quality, or Relation whatever, till their bruitiſh ſpirits were quite tired out with continual ſlaughters and butcheries.</p>
               <p>But after that light which ſhineth in darkneſs, guided them to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of that bleſſed Truth, whoſe meekneſs miraculouſly allay'd their rough natures, they became ſo flexible and obedient to the principles of their new Faith, as men that thought they could never expiate their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer inhumanities, but by an exceſs of zeal, they did as immoderately waſt themſelves in repairing the ruines they had made, raiſing ſo many new Structures, that the number as well as the beauty ſo far exceeded all thoſe of former times, that it might have been ſaid of this Iſle as once of <hi>Rome,</hi> that it ſeem'd but one great Monaſtery; the piety of their Kings ſo ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting their policy, that many of them turned their Scepters into Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiers,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:51478:60"/> and exchang'd their Crowns for Miters, their Princes thinking it a greater glory to be made Prieſts, than their Prieſts thought it to be made Princes.</p>
               <p>Thus they conquer'd themſelves before they had half conquer'd the <hi>Britains;</hi> and as 'tis obſervable how by their contention for Heaven, they were happily brought to imitate it, in that wonderful work of the Circulation of the Globe, effected by the power of that truly divine Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the Art of Navigation, firſt reduc'd into practice by them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they had the honour to be the firſt that reſolv'd the <hi>Non ultra</hi> of the Ancients, into a <hi>Plus ultra,</hi> diſcovering another World, which neither the <hi>Greeks</hi> nor <hi>Romans</hi> ever knew: So it is more than probable, that if they had quietly enjoy'd the benefit of their Conqueſt here at home, after it came to be entire and abſolute, without that interruption they had from the <hi>Dana,</hi> (who finding them buſi'd in an inteſtine War one with another, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermin'd them by Land, before they could perfect any great matter by Sea) they had not contented themſelves as they did, with an Inſulary glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; having laid ſo good a foundation to an univerſal Empire, and ſo much more laſting than any that were ever before it, by how much they would have had it in their power, to have ſecur'd the obedience of the reſt of the World by their ignorance, rendring themſelves their Maſters, by a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of State not to be reſiſted, becauſe not underſtood, whereof our Kings their Succeſſors, now abſolute Lords of the Sea, have happily made good proof. For as a modern Poet hath well obſerv'd:

Laſtly, Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fierceneſs of the <hi>Britains</hi> of the one ſide, and the fraud of the <hi>Danes</hi> of the other, thoſe perhaps doing them more miſchief by Treaties, than t'other by admitting no ceſſation: We may conclude with the Poet,

So 'tis as probable this man was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Souldier nor Scholar, but (as the <hi>Athenian</hi> ſaid) one that knew how to govern either; otherwiſe he could not have diſpos'd all things as he did ſo much to the advantage of his Succeſſors, that in fewer Months then others took up Years, they ſpread their Wings over no leſs then ſix of the moſt goodly Provinces, according to <hi>Ptolomey's</hi> accompt, but by that of their own, when they cantred the whole into Shires, it was no leſs then ſeventeen, which in <hi>Alfrids</hi> Tripartite Diviſion, made one third part of the whole Iſle: too great a Gripe to have been held long, had not the Reign of his Succeſſor, who laid the Superſtructure as wiſely, as he the Foundation, fortunately confirm'd the Fabrick till it was ſetled and paſt ſhaking; a happy beginning, that made thoſe that came after, not only the Terrour of their Enemies, but the Envy of their Neighbours, whereof no leſs then Four aſſaulted his Grand-ſon at once, and thoſe not the meaneſt; <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Northumber,</hi> the <hi>Eaſt-Angle,</hi> the <hi>Weſt-Saxon,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Kent,</hi> keeping him at a Bay, as a Lyon in a Toyl, till Fate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring with his Forces, drove ſome of them out of their Confidence, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers out of their Kingdoms, and the reſt out of the World: Some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding by a Tribute, others by Homage, the reſt with loſs of their Lives; Proſperity prompting him to ſcorn all Conditions of Peace, till he gave them a greater advantage by their diſpair, then themſelves could have hoped from their natural Fortitude; for not knowing how to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, he took from them all hopes of yielding, and ſhewed them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a way to conquer him, which they could not have found before he wrote himſelf <hi>Univerſal Monarch;</hi> a Title he deſign'd to rip out of the

Whilſt they were Pagans, they fortified themſelves by extraordinary Acts of Cruelty; but after they became Chriſtians, they rais'd them by as great works of Charity.

To them ſhe gave only Title to part, but to him the Dominion of the whole Iſle; Nature a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing to fit his Parts to the proportion of his Preferment: For as he was young and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſo he was temperate and diſcreet; noble by Birth (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from <hi>Ingill,</hi> Brother to <hi>Ine</hi> the Magnificent) but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler by his Bounty, which had purchas'd him ſo univerſal an Affection, that his Predeceſſor <hi>Bithrick</hi> ſuſpecting the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of his Vertues, made them ſo far his Crimes, as to give him a fair pretenſe to baniſh him; by which means all his good Qualities came to be ſo refin'd (breathing in a purer Air then that of his native Soil) as leaves it yet in doubt, Whether he were any whit leſs beholding to Providence then Nature; his Afflictions contributing ſo much to his Experience, his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience to his Wiſdom, and his Wiſdom to his Fame, that they ſeem'd like ſo many ſteps fitly plac'd together, by which he might aſcend the Throne. He ſerv'd the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, in that great Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of his into <hi>Italy,</hi> which took up all the time of his baniſhment; and there he ſo well govern'd himſelf, that he return'd with a Teſtimonial of his fitneſs to govern others. The Tyrant <hi>Bithrick</hi> who had expuls'd him, finding (when it was too late) that by driving him further from his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, he had brought him nearer to the Affections of his Country-men, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe of the Vulgar ſort, who firſt pity, then praiſe men in diſtreſs, and not ſeldom by their Opinion make up the want in Merit, and where there is no want, add ſo great a Weight, that 'tis not in the power of Humane Policy to turn the Scale: Yet he did not think fit to return, till after <hi>Bith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>'s death, as judging it more danger then honor to ſerve one, under whom 'twas a Crime to be Victorious, and Capital to be otherwiſe. Beſides, he thought it greater to let Honour ſeek him, then for him to ſeek it; knowing that Neceſſity, if not Choice, would move his Country-men to call him home, being begirt with potent Neighbours, that wanted nothing but a Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Intelligence, to ſubvert them totally: So much were they diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by their Fears from without, and their Diſcontents within. Neither miſs'd he of the Invitation he look'd for, being receiv'd with ſo univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Satisfaction, that it appear'd he was their Lord, before he became their Soveraign.

But no ſooner had the loud Acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his over joy'd People awaken'd his Lyon-like Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but rouzing up himſelf he confronted the Common Foe with ſuch a ſilent Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as look'd like a belief of conquering them without a ſtroke: for he fought only one Battle with the <hi>Danes,</hi> and no more; wherein he preſs'd upon them with that inconſideration, as ſhew'd that the apprehenſions of future danger had made him altogether contemn the preſent, the ſlaughter on their ſide being ſo great, that he thinking it not worth the trouble to bury their Carcaſſes in ſeveral Graves, caus'd them to be gather'd into congeſted heaps; and by thoſe diſmal Monuments of their unhappy Courage, left to Poſterity ſo many Land-marks of a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Conqueſt. That which made this Victory of his appear more ſerene (like the Air after a Thunder ſtorm) was the ſudden Calm which followed after it; all thoſe fierce Infidels being ſo wholly diſpers'd and defeated, that having nothing more to do relating to War, he bethought himſelf of performing ſome notable Act of Peace: And accordingly made a Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to <hi>Rome;</hi> where it appears how welcom he was, by the magnificent Reception he had of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the Fourth, who not only entertain'd him a whole year upon his own Charge, but anointed his darling Son <hi>Elfrid</hi> (who accompanied him thither) to the expectation of his Kingdom after him: wherein whether his Holineſs intended an Obligation to the Father, in honouring the Son, that was thought moſt like him, and certainly moſt belov'd of him; or whether it were that being his God-ſon, he could not beſtow upon him any cheaper Bleſſing, then an Airy Title, which yet ſeem'd to be a Prophetical Deſignation to the Crown; or what other Cauſe mov'd him to prop up the old, with ſetting up a young King, is not known: But in the Conſequence it prov'd a fatal Complement to them both: For <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bald</hi> the elder Brother, apprehending that he was rejected, being a Prince of a furious and vindictive Spirit, attempted to do himſelf right by ſuch an unnatural Wrong as never any Son offer'd to a Father before, taking his exception from the moſt unreaſonable, and one would have thought the moſt
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:51478:74"/> frivolous Ground that could be imaginable. For the Father having given the Complement of Majeſty to his young Queen, the fair Daughter of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the Bald (whom he had married in his return through <hi>France</hi>) contrary (as his Son urg'd) to a Law made by the <hi>Weſt-Sexe,</hi> who (after <hi>Bithrick</hi> was poyſon'd by his Queen) ordain'd that no Engliſh Queen ever after ſhould be allow'd the Title, place, or Priviledge of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty; he took that Occaſion from the reſpect ſhew'd to his Mother in Law to juſtifie himſelf ſo far in his diſreſpect to his Father, that without more ado he ſeiz'd the Crown, and kept out both Father and Brother: the People (who are apt to adore the riſing Sun) declaring their readineſs to ſtand by him, as he by the Laws: The ſhame and horror of wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The truth is, he was very ſevere toward the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood upon account of their Lazineſs; which provok'd them by way of Recrimination, to declaim as much againſt him for his Laſciviouſneſs; their Revenge appearing to be like themſelves, truly Spiritual, in that it ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viv'd the Occaſion, and proved ſo immortal a Defamation, as is like to continue as long as there is any mention made of him in any Story, his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces being repreſented in ſuch a Magnifying Glaſs as dilated them to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Deformity, more ſuitable to a Monſter then a Man.

Hence it was that there was not the leaſt noiſe of War all his Time, nor ſcarce a whiſper of Rebellion; Except ſome little Demurrers of diſcontent, put in by the <hi>Welch</hi> Princes, preſuming upon their Poverty; for that which is the weakneſs of other Princes, was their only Ground of Confidence; but that little Inflammation ceas'd by the letting out of a very little blood; the <hi>Danes</hi> who were then eſteem'd the only, as the neareſt Enemy, lying ſtill like Silk-worms in Winter, without the leaſt motion or appearance of Life: in Fine, the peace attended his Government was ſo univerſal, that to ſignalize the Calm, he added to the Arms of his Anceſtors four Martlets, Birds that much delight to be about Water, and moſt if not wholly in clear and ſtill Seaſons, for ſuch indeed was his Raign (as a Calm between Storms) which had it been as long as 'twas proſperous, he had not only paſs'd for the moſt Auguſt Prince of this Nation, but this for the moſt Auſpicate Kingdom perhaps on this ſide the World; he as keeping the Keys, and that as being the Storehouſe to all other Nations.

'TIS eaſie to imagine by the Title of Martyr gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the laſt King, what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flex his Death had upon this, who like an ill-ſet plant, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily plac'd in the ſame Room, from which the other was taken, never could recover any firm rooting, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently never thriv'd, being continually wind-ſhaken from the very firſt moment that he was ſet up, and vext with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſant troubles; the Sword never departing from his Houſe (as 'tis reported St. <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan</hi> preaching at his Coronati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on boldly foretold) till the common Enemy became Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of his ill-got Glory, repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with the miſery of loſs, and that infelicity which always attends it, ſhame and reproach. For 'tis obſerv'd, that notwithſtanding there were ſcarcely any King that ever ſetled the conſtitutions of his Government upon firmer principles, that fought his Battels with braver Reſolution, that encountred all Emergencies of State with like indifferency and temperance; yet neither could his vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance or valour, his prudence, fortitude, or patience ſo prevail againſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny, but that all his deſigns were ſtifled in the birth, or fruſtrated at the very point of diſpatch; as if Heaven had decreed to lay ſuch a curſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the wickedneſs of his Parent, as ſhould weigh down all the merit of his Vertues, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

One while Famin was his Foe, another time Peſtilence, and it was not rare for the very Elements themſelves to fight againſt him; it being more than once or twice that he had a kind of Battel with Heaven it ſelf, for his Fleets were in danger of being fired by unexpected Lightning and Thunder-Storms; neither was it for a little time that he thus ſtrugled with the perverſeneſs of his Stars, hoping the malignity of their Influences might ſpend it ſelf in due ſeaſon but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they gave him no opportunity or incouragement to perform any wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Action, for ſeveral years together, having plac'd all Glory ſo far above the reach of his Sword, that 'twas impoſſible he could at the ſame time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be valiant and wiſe, he deſpair'd by ſenſible degrees: and as one grown weary of Greatneſs, became leſs concern'd, as he found Fortune more froward; till at length he fell under the loweſt Reproach that could befall an active Prince, to be ſtil'd <hi>The Unready</hi> (for ſo was he miſ-call'd) the apprehenſions of which indignity ſo wholly relaxed his Spirits, that he reſolv'd to purchaſe what he could not win, a little reſt (I cannot call it peace, being rather like a Submiſſion than a Ceſſation) which yet he paid an incredible price for, indeed no leſs than 10000 pounds; a vaſt Sum for thoſe times, and ſo much the dearer pennyworth to his poor people, in as much as
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:51478:83"/> it was the occaſion of a Tax, which not only was the very firſt they ever knew, but was executed with ſo much rigour, that the ſhame and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he conceived thereupon, put him upon waſhing off the Stain of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour with a deluge of innocent blood: exaſperating him to the hazard of the worſt of remedies, a general Maſſacre throughout his Territories; which afterward, was executed upon the <hi>Danes</hi> with ſo much ſecrecy, and ſo little compaſſion, that very few, if any of them, eſcap'd. 'Twas thought this one Act, however cruel, would have freed him from all future fears of the like neceſſity for the time to come; but that weight which would have fixt the pillars of his Government upon their Baſes, had they continued upright; leaning on one ſide, overcharg'd and crack'd them: for the bold Executioners of his rage, upon the firſt preparation the Enemy made for Revenge, finding themſelves diſappointed in the main ends of their Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, turn'd Cowards, and by a ſtrange infatuation quit his Protection, to ſeek refuge from thoſe whom yet they believ'd implacable: who having no colour of right, till this wrong was done to them, had now ſo fair a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to do what e're was foul, that King <hi>Swain</hi> himſelf thought it obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory upon him, to croſs the Sea to ſee right done to the incenſed ghoſts of his People: The terrour of whoſe firſt approach made ſuch impreſſions upon the very wiſeſt of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that they thought it better to give him the poſſeſſion of their Country, than hazard his undertaking it from them, yielding up moſt of the great Towns and Cities, to diſappoint his Fury by unexpected ſubmiſſion. Only <hi>London</hi> ſtood firm to King <hi>Ethelred</hi> in this extremity, and left him not till he left them; who having before the Storm came, ſent away his Wife and Children into <hi>Normandy,</hi> follow'd them him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf not long after; leaving <hi>Swain</hi> in the ſole poſſeſſion of the Kingdom: who from thence forward had nothing more to do, but to bind thoſe he had thus conquer'd with chains of Allegiance.

A little after this (which was yet before the Incarnation) they began to undermine their next Neighbours the <hi>Jutes,</hi> who (as <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> relates) dwelt right over againſt them, on the <hi>Cherſoneſs,</hi> that jets out into the <hi>Aouſt Sea.</hi> By that Conteſt they gave the World ſo good an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their skill in Naval Fights, that the <hi>Jutes</hi> weary of their Vicini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, left them the poſſeſſion of that <hi>Promontory,</hi> and came themſelves over into this Iſle of ours.</p>
               <p>Thus by commanding the <hi>Sea,</hi> they made themſelves firſt Lords at Land, and with their new Seats they got a new Name; the broad-mouth'd Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern People about thoſe parts, calling them the <hi>DANS:</hi> whether from <hi>Dan</hi> their King, as ſome, too ancient to be refuted, fancy; or from <hi>Dom,</hi> the abbreviation of <hi>Dominus</hi> (as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> got the Stile of <hi>Don</hi> amongſt them) being of that haughty humour, that they would be called by no other name after they came hither, but <hi>Lordanes;</hi> or whether from <hi>DAN,</hi>

               <p>They were (as indeed moſt of the Inhabitants of the Septentrional part of the world) a hardy and bold (I cannot ſay brave) People: for their behaviour was plain and rude, and they ſo affected their own manners, that however they were led by Providence into Countries where they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took more of Civility and the Sun, yet they would not be mov'd to change any of their ancient Cuſtomes, having but little ſenſe of honour, and leſs of danger, aiming more at gain then glory: Inſomuch, that they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſtrangers to ſuch gay diſtinctions of Honour as are ſince in faſhion, and wherewith thoſe now in <hi>Denmark</hi> have been but very lately acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: the reaſon was, for that all their Dignities were Perſonal, and not He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary, held by no other Charter but that of their Vertue: So that their wiſe Kings obſerving that old Adage, <hi>Virtutis Laus Actio,</hi> never ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them to want freſh Occaſions of Action, whereby they ſold them the honour they pretended to give them, by parting with it not ſo much as a Reward of paſt, as an earneſt of future Services. Neither did this a little inhance the value of their Nobility, which being for term of life only, as it fell ſooner into the Kings hands, to be remunerated again with better improvement and advantage, ſo the Perſons dignifi'd were not apt to be infected with thoſe haughty conceipts, which moſt uſually puff up the minds of ſuch as are born Noble, who believing ſomething to be in their Blood, that differences them from the common Rank of Subjects (the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation whereof they have either forgotten, or hold to be diſcharg'd by their Anceſtors) grow inſolent and factious, and by their diſloyalty not ſeldom diſturb both their own Families, and the Kingdoms peace: Of this <hi>Knute</hi> had ſo ſad a proof, that as ſoon as he came to be King of <hi>England,</hi> he indeavoured to diſcharge all his Grandees, that might any way pretend to have any ſhare in his Conqueſt, cruſhing the two great Paladines, <hi>Irtus</hi> and <hi>Turkill,</hi> the one Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> t'other of <hi>Merkland;</hi> each of whoſe Principalities were ſo independent, and govern'd by ſuch diſtinct Laws as made them ſo abſolute, that the Monarchy till then looked like a Tetrarchy; but he was forc'd at the ſame time to baniſh Ten thouſand of his other Country-men, only to be rid of them two: putting himſelf by an unuſual Confidence, upon the Faith of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> whom to oblige the more, he taught the knowledge of their own Strength (which till then they ſeem'd ignorant of) ſhewing them the way to Victory in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries;
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:51478:86"/> where while they became Conquerours under him, they forgot the hate conceiv'd for being conquer'd by him: Neither was he leſs care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in Peace, to heal the wounds receiv'd in War, by applying the Balſome of wholſome Laws, in the making whereof he had a particular Art to meet with the Diſtempers of the Times; wiſely providing againſt ſuch as were likely to have become Epidemical: But more particularly ſevere was he againſt that ſottiſh ſin of Drinking, then ſo much in faſhion, not without ſome ſecret inſtinct perhaps, or preſage of what did happen after, that it would prove fatal to the Glory of his own Houſe, and not only cut off every Branch thereof, but be the occaſion of rooting out his Nation ſo full and wholly, that in two Succeſſions after him, there ſhould not be found ſcarce one Family in the whole Iſle, that could ſo trace their broken Pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, through the obſcure windings and deviations of their ſo often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted Hiſtory, as to prove himſelf of <hi>Daniſh</hi> Extract, both by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mother.</p>
               <p>But as it was too great an Undertaking to ſubdue the Vices of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domitable Age, where if they had not thirſted for wine, they would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps for blood: So much leſs was he able to conteſt with Heaven, which had put them a period for a Penalty, and bound them up by an inviſible Chain of Cauſes, beyond the length of which they could not make one ſtep forward: The Links whereof were peradventure no more (and therefore the heavier) then what was proper for the myſtical number of their three Letter'd Name of <hi>DAN:</hi> for as their Monarchy held only three Deſcents, ſo the whole Syſteme of their Conqueſt, with every Action, Accident, and Atchievement therein, ſeems to be circumſcribed within the Circle of that hree corner'd ſquare, with like Fatality as the <hi>Britains</hi> were rul'd by the Number of Six, and the <hi>Romans</hi> by that of Seven: For as they were ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally divided into three Tribes, ſo each Tribe had as many Kingdoms, and thereupon they gave for their ancient Arms three times three<note n="*" place="margin">Olao Worms Monument.

So when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan their Invaſion here, 'tis obſervable they had but only Three Ships, which yet landed not all at once, but in three ſeveral places, and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable Party they brought over, were conducted by three Generals, each equal in Truſt and Honour; theſe were <hi>Gurmo, Byorn,</hi> and <hi>Sytherick,</hi> who began that cruel war that followed: upon their Departure came over <hi>Ingar, Ivor,</hi> and <hi>Hubbo,</hi> three fierce Brothers, which were ſeconded by <hi>Gurmo</hi> the younger, <hi>Eskell</hi> and <hi>Amond,</hi> as they again back'd by <hi>Cockric, Haſtang,</hi> and <hi>Rollo.</hi> The three great <hi>Triumviri</hi> in the height of the war were <hi>Edric, Stroeg,</hi> and <hi>Halidine:</hi> after them ſucceeded <hi>Sytherick</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, <hi>Godfred,</hi> and <hi>Anlaff:</hi> after whom were <hi>Eric</hi> the Second, <hi>Anlaff</hi> the Second, and <hi>Swain:</hi> not to mention, <hi>Fran, Frithegiſt,</hi> and <hi>Frothoe,</hi> whoſe names were over-whelm'd by <hi>Irtus, Turkill,</hi> and <hi>Knute,</hi> who were the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers up of the Rear, and ended the war; the laſt of whom was the firſt had the good fortune to ſhake off his right and left hand-men in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

Laſtly, as they had a

Several perſons were corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with golden promiſes of great Preferments in caſe they could effect the black deed: but Providence being more kind to him, then he to himſelf, prevented his further guilt, by putting an end to his loathed life, which yet had concluded happily enough, if either his infamy had ended with himſelf, or himſelf had been at reſt when he ended: But being the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples terrour whiles he was alive, the King, his Adverſary that ſucceeded him, took that advantage to make him their ſcorn after he was dead, raking up his Aſhes out of the Duſt where it was laid, to expoſe it to another Element, as reſtleſs as was himſelf: whereby, though in effect he did no more but rob the Worms, to gratifie the Fiſhes, yet the Common ſort judging there was ſomething more of Inhumanity in the manner, then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps of Injuſtice in the matter of the Revenge, it melted down their hate into a kind of pity; and as their ſpight for the moſt part ends with their fears, ſo forgetting their own, they became ſo ſenſible of his wrong, that
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:51478:98"/> from that time they withdrew their affections from that King, and had doubtleſs expos'd him (had he not prevented it by expoſing himſelf) to ſome danger as great as that he met with.</p>

The firſt in right to the Crown, were Prince <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> and <hi>Edmond,</hi> the Sons of <hi>Ironſides:</hi> but the remoteneſs of their Perſons, being of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conſideration then the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Titles, having ever ſince the death of their Father, continued as Out-laws in <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary</hi> (to which Crown they were ſo nearly allyed, that he was put beſide all hope of tampering with them) he prefer'd their Uncle <hi>Edward,</hi> one of the younger Sons of <hi>Ethelred;</hi> a Prince ſo ſoft and plyant, that he ſeem'd to be fram'd by Nature for every Impreſſion that was to be put upon him: to him therefore he gave up the Crown, and with it (as a Bribe) a Jewel (perhaps of greater value, if it had been rightly us'd or underſtood) his vertuous Daughter <hi>Edith;</hi> a Lady of ſo incomparable perſon and parts, that he might be very well confident he had made all cock-ſure (as we vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly ſay) knowing that whenever he came within the Circle of her Arms, he muſt be ſo charm'd (if he had any thing of man in him) as never to be able to get looſe again: This aſſurance made our Politician very bold with
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:51478:99"/> his Son in Law; that boldneſs quickly turn'd to Arrogance, that Arrogance attracted great Envy, and that Envy rais'd great Oppoſition: Thoſe of the Nobility that were men of Action, became his Rivals in Glory, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming as great things againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> as he and his Sons could do againſt the <hi>Welch;</hi> whilſt thoſe that were men of Counſel, made it their buſineſs to counter plot his Intreagues, wherein they likewiſe prevail'd ſo far, as to prefer <hi>Gemenſis</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> (the very greateſt Enemy he had) to be Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> but he being a <hi>Norman</hi> (which croſſed a wiſe Ordinance made at the coming in of the King, that no ſtranger ſhould be admitted into any place of Profit or Truſt) <hi>Goodwin</hi> made it the Kingdoms grievance more then his own: and rather then want an Occaſion to puzzle the ſhort ſighted Multitude, he took a very ſlight one, from an accidental Fray at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> between the Towns-men and ſome of the Followers of the Earl of <hi>Bolloigne,</hi> the Kings Brother in law, whoſe Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingers being kill'd in the Scuffle, the King commanded <hi>Goodwin</hi> as Lord Lieutenant of that County, to do Juſtice on the Offenders: but he deny'd, returning this popular Anſwer, That it was againſt his Conſcience to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his Country-men unheard, upon the complaint of Strangers. This coldneſs of his rais'd ſuch a ſudden heat in the Common People, that there wanted nothing to ſet the whole Kingdom in a Flame, but to tell them their Liberties were in danger, and that there was no body durſt aſſert them but the Earl <hi>Goodwin.</hi> King <hi>Edward</hi> perceiving his deſign, and doubting leaſt it might bring him himſelf into ſuſpition with his People, being upon the matter a Stranger (as having been alwayes brought up in <hi>Normandy</hi>) he reſolv'd to queſtion him in open Parliament: and accordingly he ſummon'd him and his Sons to give their attendance: but they refuſing to appear, both ſides armed. <hi>London</hi> was divided in the Quarrel; for the King poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed all on this ſide the <hi>Thames,</hi> the Earl all on the other ſide next <hi>Kent:</hi> But ſuch is the terrour of Guilt, that the Night before the Battel was to be fought, the Rebels quit their General, and by that commendable Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, forc'd him to quit the Realm, who taking ſhipping at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> fled away as faſt by water, as his Complices did by Land. The King upon this turn was ſo changed in his humour (incenſed at this their groſs contumacy) that he grew extreamly cholerick and peeviſh, diſcharging his Anger with that violence upon all the Earls Friends, that it recoil'd back upon the ſpotleſs Queen her ſelf; whom, in the tranſport of his Paſſion he accus'd of a<note n="*" place="margin">Incontinency</note> Crime, which if ſhe had been guilty of, himſelf could not have been Innocent: having (as he was not aſhamed afterwards to confeſs) never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd the Duty of a Husband to her; under which pretended Jealouſie ſhe was forced to ſuffer a years Impriſonment in a Cloyſter, partaking pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently the Pennance of thoſe, who were under a Vow never to know any man, only to ſatisfie him, who had before vowed never to know any wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. This Indignity offer'd to the Innocent Daughter (in whom (ſaith <hi>Ingulphus</hi>) there was no fault but that ſhe was a Roſe of that prickly ſtock) did ſo ſtimulate the guilty Father, for whoſe ſake ſhe ſuffer'd, that he me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated nothing but the extreameſt Revenge, and by frequent Piracies ſo diſturb'd all Trade, that the King finding that the popular were on his ſide, was glad to compound with him for his quiet, upon his own tearms, yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the baniſhment of all Strangers; which Conceſſion did his buſineſs, but undid the Kingdoms: For as it made way for his Son to be (as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd him) a King, ſo it was the fatal occaſion of that unexpected Invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Normans,</hi> (abetted by the Earl of <hi>Bolloigne,</hi> that had the firſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front given him) which not long after not only overwhelm'd the particular
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:51478:100"/> honour of his own Family, but the glory of the whole Engliſh Nation, by a Conqueſt ſo univerſal and ſudden, as if the Strangers they baniſh'd had gone out of the Country for no other end, but to fetch in more: However, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſuffered not him to ſee either the fruit or puniſhment of his dark pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes; it ſo falling out, that whilſt he deſign'd to have devour'd the whole Kingdom, he was himſelf choak'd with a ſmall morſel of Bread, that went the wrong way down, and by his death put ſuch a full point to all great Actions, as ſhews that either he did all that was done then, or the King did not long ſurvive him; whoſe Reign being nothing elſe but a Commentary upon that Earl's Ambition, 'tis no marvel that his Fame began where t'others ended, being ſounded upon Opinion rather then Action; whilſt his Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity was interpreted Patience, and his Patience judg'd the Effect of Wiſdom: But they that duly examine the whole courſe of his life, will find that the active part of it declar'd him ſcarce a good man, the paſſive certainly not a good King: and however the Clergy (who were well brib'd) extoll'd his Chaſtity and Piety, yet 'tis evident that the firſt was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out manifeſt wrong to his Wife (whom not to uſe was the higheſt abuſe) the laſt with no leſs Ingratitude towards his Mother, whom upon like ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he put to ſuch a kind of Purgation, as might have condemn'd the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Innocence, cauſing her to paſs the<note n="*" place="margin">To go over 9 red hot Hough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhares bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed &amp; blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, laid at un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain diſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, either of which if ſhe touch'd, ſhe was hold guilty.</note> 
                  <hi>Ordeale,</hi> or Fiery Tryal then in faſhion: But this unkindneſs to them is the leſs, when compar'd with that to himſelf, in the total diſregard of all Poſterity; affecting more to be a Benefactor to, then a Father of his Country, as believing Religious Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes more laſting Monuments then Religious Children; whereby it came to paſs that for want of Iſſue of his own Body, he was fain to leave the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to one that was both a Child and a Stranger, little knowing, and leſs known to the Engliſh, as not having ſo much of the Language, as might ſerve to demand or declare his Right when he was to recover it, nor ſo much Spirit or Judgment, as to ſhew himſelf ſenſible of the Injury when he was afterwards put beſides it. A fit adopted Succeſſor for ſuch a Sacerdoting King, of whom if I ſhould give an impartial Character, I muſt ſay, that he was rather cold then chaſt, rather ſuperſtitious then religious, fitter to be a Monk then a Monarch; indeed ſo ſottiſh, that (as 'tis reported of <hi>Vitellius</hi>) he would have forgotten he was born a Prince, if others had not put him in mind of it. So that 'tis no marvel, conſidering either his own weakneſs, or his that was to have come after him, that his Steward <hi>Harold,</hi> by having on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the rule of his Houſhold, ſhould take upon him (as he did) to rule the Kingdom, and he thought the fitteſt man (however half a <hi>Dane</hi>) to ſupport the Engliſh Monarchy.</p>

The pretenders were <hi>Swain</hi> King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> whoſe claim was as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Heir of the laſt <hi>Knute;</hi> and <hi>William</hi> Duke of <hi>Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> that ſet up a Title by Gift and Conveyance from the laſt King <hi>Edward:</hi> But of theſe, the firſt was ingaged in a War with the <hi>Swede,</hi> the laſt imbroyl'd in a diſpute with the <hi>French,</hi> and ſo neither at leiſure (as he thought) to diſturb him.

Neither want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he ſomething like a gilded Title to dazle the Common Peoples eyes; for beſides that he was Heir to the Fame and Fortune of the great <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win,</hi> the Champion of their Liberties, deſcended from the Kings of the <hi>Weſt-Sexe,</hi> which gave him the preferrence of the <hi>Norman,</hi> ſo by the Mothers ſide he had in him the Royal Blood of <hi>Denmark,</hi> which by the advantage of his preſent poſſeſſion, gave him the Superiority of thoſe Kings too. Thus fortified and adorned, he undertook to make the People as happy, as they had made him Great: and becauſe Triſles pleaſe Children as well as greater matters, he call'd himſelf Prince <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi>'s Protector; fooling thoſe of his Party into a belief, that he intended ſomething towards him, that might amount to a Surrender in convenient time, or at leaſt to a Confirmation of the Succeſſion after him, which
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:51478:101"/> they were well contented with. Thus having by many Lines drawn to himſelf an univerſal Conſent, that made his Right of Deſert equivalent with t'others Right of Deſcent, he hung like a Spider by the ſlender thread ſpun out of his own Bowels, which, how weak ſoever it ſeem'd, was ſtrong enough to bear him up, till he had put his Affairs into as good a Poſture of Security as the preſent neceſſity would permit. And it ſo fell out, that the firſt that queſtion'd him, was the laſt that aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, his next Neighbour the <hi>Norman,</hi> who pretending to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of King <hi>Edwards</hi> Right to him, to which (as he ſaid) <hi>Harold</hi> himſelf was Witneſs, and (which was more) ſworn by Oath to defend, he tax'd him upon his Allegiance to make good the ſame; to which <hi>Harold</hi> return'd a ſhort Anſwer, That Oaths exacted <hi>par Dureſſe,</hi> were not binding (for taking his pleaſure (as it is ſaid) one day at Sea, he was by contrary winds drove into <hi>Normandy,</hi> and there detain'd till he took that Oath). 2. He ſaid that his private compact with the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> was of no validity, without the conſent of the whole State of <hi>England.</hi> 3. That no Act of King <hi>Edward</hi>'s could paſs the Crown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, being himſelf intitled to it but by Election, and ſo holding only in Truſt. Laſtly, that the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and Dukedom of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi> were enough for two Perſons, and too much to be rul'd by one, and therefore Nature had well placed a Sea betwixt them: which Sea, becauſe he thought the <hi>Norman</hi> could not paſs, he concluded he would not deveſt himſelf of the Dignity Providence had given him with the conſent of the People.</p>
               <p>By this Duke <hi>William</hi> finding that Arms, not Arguments, muſt decide the Controverſie, reſolv'd to drive out one wedge with another; and accordingly working upon the Revenge and Ambition of <hi>Touſtan, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold</hi>'s younger Brother, then in his Court, who was tainted with an irreconcileable Enmity both to his Brother and Country: to him for a Box of the Ear given him in the preſence of King <hi>Edward;</hi> to it, for a worſe blow, in depoſing him from his Government in <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and forcing him into Exile, whereby he was neceſſitated to appear ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like a Pirate then a Prince; he prevail'd with him to make the firſt Invaſion: who aſſiſted by the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> and the King of <hi>Norwey,</hi> (then ingaged in taking in the Northern Iſles) landed in his own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and thence pierc'd into the very Bowels of the Kingdom, forcing his Brother <hi>Harold</hi> (though with apparent hazard) to leave <hi>London</hi> to make what ſpeed he could to check their forwardneſs; who accordingly advanc'd as far as <hi>Stamford,</hi> where he put an end to the troubles of his Brother and the <hi>Norweygian,</hi> but not to his own: For as he was allaying this Storm in the North, he had notice of a more dreadful one in the South; the <hi>Norman</hi> having ſo tim'd his buſineſs, that he landed that very day that his Confederates were fighting; with whom came over the Great Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> Father in Law to <hi>Touſtan,</hi> as well as to himſelf, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the Earl of <hi>Bulloigne,</hi> who had been ſo inhoſpitably treated at <hi>Canterbury</hi> by <hi>Harold</hi>'s Father. <hi>Harold</hi> tarried not to ſheath his blood-ſtain'd Swords, leſt ruſting in their Scabards, they ſhould be hardly drawn forth again: But leading his men on, weary as they were, to compleat the firſt by a ſecond Victory, in leſs time then could be thought poſſible to have march'd ſo far, he fac'd the Invaders with ſo much confidence, that Duke <hi>William</hi> loath to venture all at one ſtake, ſent him the offer of referring it to the Pope, or putting the trial up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſingle Combat betwixt them two.

About the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great they began to grow ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry troubleſome by their frequent Pyracies, making ſeveral Inroads into <hi>England,</hi> but eſpecially into <hi>France,</hi> preſſing ſo hard upon <hi>Lewis</hi> the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he was fain to empty all his frontier Garriſons, and quitting the Maritime, draw them into the interior and more conſiderable parts of his Empire, as the Spirits are drawn to the heart upon all Commotions to preſerve life: Their Succeſſes in <hi>Germany, England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> having made them ſo bold, that they doubted not to advance as far as <hi>Paris;</hi> where after divers diſputes with <hi>Charles</hi> the Bald, <hi>Charles le Groſse,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the Simple (which concluded with an honourable Compoſition) they ſix'd their two Chiefs, <hi>Haſtang</hi> and <hi>Rollo</hi> in the moſt fertile and beſt parts of that goodly Country; the firſt being made Earl of <hi>Charters,</hi> the laſt Duke of <hi>Neuſtria</hi> (from him call'd afterwards <hi>Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>) the ſeventh in deſcent from whom was Duke <hi>William,</hi> better known to us here by the Name of <hi>The Conquerour,</hi> who with like confidence, and not unlike Injuſtice, invaded <hi>England,</hi> as his Anceſtors did <hi>France,</hi> pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Donation of the Soveraignty from his near Kinſman King <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor, confirm'd, as he alledged, by his laſt Will and Teſtament, in the preſence of moſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility: a pretence that could have been of no validity, had it not been back'd by more then humane Power, to diſinherit <hi>Edgar Atheling,</hi> who (as being of the whole <hi>Engliſh</hi> Blood)
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:51478:104"/> was rather Heir to the Kingdom then to the King, and ſo by no Law could have his Right collated to a Stranger; but the uſe he made of it was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the World, that he had more Reaſon, not to ſay Right, to demand, than <hi>Harold</hi> to detain the Crown, who having put Prince <hi>Edgar</hi> beſides the Succeſſion, deſied the Juſtice of all Mankind as he was an Uſurper, and ſo it was a deſign worthy his Sword, who had ſo fortunately vanquiſh'd (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven before he wrote Man) thoſe great difficulties at home given by the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Domeſtick Rivals, no leſs puiſſant and populous then <hi>Harold,</hi> to put him at leaſt out of Poſſeſſion: But that which ſeems ſtrange, and was queſtionleſs a great ſurprize upon <hi>Harold,</hi> was the conjunction of the Peers of <hi>France</hi> in an Action that was ſo apparently hazardous to the greatneſs of their own State; every addition to ſo near and dangerous a Neighbour, grown long before too powerful, being a kind of diminution unto them, whereof there can be no probable Cauſe aſſign'd, beyond their natural af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation of Glory, and wantonneſs of Courage, but that Influence which the Conquerors Father in Law, <hi>Baldwin</hi> Earl of <hi>Flanders</hi> had, by being then Governour of the King and Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> who not only ingaged moſt of the grtateſt Perſons there, as the Duke of <hi>Orleance,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Champaigne, Blois, Brittain, Ponthieue, Maine, Nevers, Poictiers, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male,</hi> and <hi>Anjou,</hi> but drew in the<note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>This Preparation being ſuch as it was, it cannot be thought that the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> loſt any honour, by mingling blood with men of that Quality and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the ſound of whoſe Names, was perhaps little leſs terrible then that of their Arms: much leſs takes it from the reputation of their Courage, to have he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d up the diſpute but for one day only, having fought it out as they did, till the number of the ſlain ſo far exceeded that of the living, as made the Conqueror doubt there would not be enough left to be conquer'd. Who knows not that Fate made way for the <hi>Normans,</hi> where their Swords could not, guiding them by a Series of Succeſſes (near about the ſame time) to the expectation of an univerſal Empire, having but a little before made themſelves Lords of <hi>Apulia, Calabria, Scicily,</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> and inlarged their Conqueſts as far as <hi>Paleſtine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what we allow to the Courage, we muſt take from the Wiſdom of the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> that being ſubdued, they continued <hi>Neſcia vinci,</hi> vexing the Conqueror after they had ſubmitted to him, by ſuch continual Revolts, as ſuffered him not to ſheath his Sword all his Reign; or if he did, urged him to continue ſtill ſo ſuſpicious of their Loyalty, that he was ſorc'd alway to keep his hand upon the hilt, ready to draw it forth, having not leiſure to intend what was before eſtabliſhed, much leſs to eſtabliſh what he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore intended; So that they put upon him a kind of neceſſity of being a Tyrant, to make good his being a King: Yet ſuch was the moderation of his mind, that he choſe rather to bind them ſtricter to him by the old Laws, then to gall them with any new, guarding his Prerogative within that Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadel of the <hi>Burrough Law</hi> (as they call'd it) from whence as often as they began to mutiny, he batter'd them with their own Ordnance, and ſo made them Parties to their own wrong; and however ſome that deſign'd to pre-occupate the grace of Servitude, gave him the ungrateful Title of <hi>Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror</hi> (which he eſteem'd the greateſt misfortune his good Fortune had brought upon him) thereby to proclaim his Power to be as boundleſs as his Will, which they took to be above all Limitation or Contradiction: yet we find he ſuffered himſelf to be ſo far conquer'd by them, that inſtead of giving to, he took the Law from them, and contentedly bound himſelf up
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:51478:104"/> by thoſe which they call'd <hi>St. Edward's Laws,</hi> which being an Abbrevia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the great triple Code of <hi>Danique, Merke,</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Sexe Laws,</hi> was ſuch a form of Combination, as he himſelf could not deſire to introduce a better; and if any thing look'd like abſolute, 'twas his diſarming them when he found them thus Law-bound hand and foot: After which he ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted divers Fortreſſes where he thought fit, diſpos'd all Offices of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and Judicature, to ſuch as he could beſt confide in; and by that Law of <hi>Cover feu,</hi> obliging them to the obſervation of better hours of Repoſe, then they had formerly been us'd to, gave himſelf more reſt, as well as them. As for his putting the Law into a Language they underſtood not, whereby they were made more learn'd, or leſs litigious then they were before; it was that the Lawyers only had cauſe to complain of, whoſe practiſe at the firſt perhaps was a little diſordered by it; but thoſe ſince, who have found the benefit of having the Laws myſterious and leſs intelligible, have little cauſe to decry him for it, unleſs for this cauſe, that they are never pleas'd with any fighting King.</p>
               <p>In fine, he ſtrain'd not the Prerogative ſo high, but his Son <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt, let it down again as low, when he reſtored to the People their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient freedom of <hi>General Aſſemblies:</hi> or rather permitted them a kind of ſhare with himſelf in the Government, by inſtituting a form of <hi>Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> ſo much nobler then any thing they had been acquainted with in elder timety, in that the Peerage ſate as ſo many Kings parting ſtakes with Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns, if what<note n="*" place="margin">Who was Lord Chief Juſtice to his Grandſon <hi>Hen.</hi> 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Bracton</hi> tells us be true, who ſaith, there were many things which by law, the King could not do without them, and ſome things which legally they might do without him: which thoſe that have read up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Statute of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> can beſt explain. This was not therefore improperly call'd the <hi>Parliament,</hi> in reſpect of the Freedom of parlying after another faſhion then had been permitted to their Anceſtors in former Meetings; which being <hi>Ex more,</hi> or (as they were wont to phraſe it) of <hi>Cuſtome Grace,</hi> during all the time of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings, we cannot imagine their Debates to be much leſs reſtrained then themſelves, who attending in the Kings Palace (like the Lords of the Councel at this day) having had the honour to give their Opinions in any point of State, ſubmitted the final Judgment and determination to the Kings will and pleaſure.

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:51478:105"/> from which time it hath been eſteemed the ſecond <hi>Great Charter of England,</hi> whereby we were manumitted into that degree of Freedom, as no Subjects in the world enjoy the like, with like ſecurity from the fear of future bondage: For as no man can be made lyable to the payment of any more or other Taxes then what himſelf layes upon himſelf, by his repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives in that great <hi>Pan-Anglio,</hi> call'd the <hi>Parliament;</hi> ſo all the Kings of <hi>England</hi> ſince that time, have been pleas'd to accept the Aids given by them, even for the neceſſary ſupport of the Government, as ſo many Freewill-Offerings: And well it is that they eſteem them free, ſince they are not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained without a kind of Compoſition, I might ſay obligation, to give good Laws for good mony, wherein the performance on the Princes part alwaies precedes that on the Peoples.</p>
               <p>But there is yet ſomething further then all this that renders the <hi>Norman Conqueſt</hi> ſo much more conſiderable then either that of the <hi>Romans, Saxons,</hi> or <hi>Danes;</hi> by how much it ſpread its wings over the Seas, into thoſe good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Provinces of the South, never known to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> before: thereby not only giving them Title to keep their Swords from ruſting, as long as they had any Arms to draw them forth, but the Advantage therewithal of a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Converſation with a civiliz'd People, who introduced ſo happy a Change in Laws and Language, in Habits and Humours, in Manners and Temperature, that not only their rough, I might ſay rude Natures (no way inclin'd before to any kind of Gaiety) admitted of ſmoother Faſhions and quicker Motions, but their dull Phlegmatick Complexions (pale and wan by the continued uſe of dozing dreggy Liquor, Ale) became as ruddy as the Wine they drank, which having more of Spirit and Fire then that other heavy compoſition, ſublimated their Courage and Wit, and render'd them more lofty and eloquent, both in Action and Language; the laſt being before ſo aſperous, harſh, and gutteral, that an hours diſcourſe together would have indanger'd the skin of their throats, but being ſoftned by the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Accents, it became ſo gentle and ſmooth, that as a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Maſter of Elocution hath obſerv'd, 'tis now ſo ſoft and pleaſing, that <q>

It being ſpace long enough, conſidering the viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of time, and power of Chance, to antiquate the glory of great States, much more of private Families, and few there are that have attain'd to that Age. For however Honour (like old Age) magnifies its reverence by mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying its years, yet it is to be conſidered, that there are viſible decayes attend Veneration, and it may ſo fall out, that Names as well as Men may out-live themſelves, while the glory of a Family, by over-length of time,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:51478:105"/> being leſs known, may be the more ſuſpected to have been but imaginary; as ſome, who exceeding the common bounds of certainty, do pretend to juſtifie their Gentility by Charters from St. <hi>Edward,</hi> and others from King <hi>Edgar,</hi> whoſe Pedigrees do yet fall ſhort of many of the <hi>Welch</hi> by many Deſcents.</p>
               <p>In fine, from the <hi>Normans</hi> we firſt learn'd how to appear like a People compleatly civiliz'd being, as more elegant in our Faſhions, ſo more ſumptuous in our Dwellings, more magnifick in our Retinue, not to ſay choicer in our Pleaſures, yet withal more frugal in our Expences: For the <hi>Engliſh</hi> being accuſtomed to bury all their Rents in the Draught, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other way to out-vie one another, but (as a<note n="†" place="margin">Jaq. Praſlin Progmat.</note> French Writer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes it) by a kind of greaſie Riot, which under the ſpecious Name of Hoſpitality, turn'd their Glory into Shame, began after the Conqueſt to conſume the Superfluity of their Eſtates, in more laſting Exceſſes; turning their Hamlets into Villes, their Villages into Towns, and their Towns into Cities, adorning thoſe Cities with goodly Caſtles, Pallaces, and Churches, which being before made up of that we call Flemmiſh Work (which is only Wood and Clay) were by the <hi>Normans</hi> converted into Brick and Stone; which till their coming, was ſo rarely uſed, that <hi>Mauritius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> being about to re-edifie <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church, burn'd in the Year 1086. was, either for want of Workmen, Materials, or both, neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not only to fetch all his Stone out of <hi>Normandy,</hi> but to form it there. So that we may conclude, if the Conqueror had not (as he did) obliged the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to a grateful continuance of his Memory, by perſonal and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Immunities, yet he deſerv'd to be Eterniz'd for this, that he ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated their minds to a higher point of Grandeur and Magnificence, and rendred the Nation capable of greater Undertakings, whereby they ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly became the moſt opulent and flouriſhing People of the World, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd in Shipping, Mariners, and Trade, in Power External as well as Internal; witneſs no leſs then two Kings made Priſoners here at one time; one of them the very greateſt of <hi>Europe:</hi> whereby they increaſed their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Revenues, as well as their private Wealth, even to the double recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing the loſs ſuſtain'd by his Entry, whilſt himſelf, however ſuppos'd by that big ſounding Title of <hi>Conqueror,</hi> to have been one of the moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Princes we had, got not ſo much ground while he was living, as to bury him here when he was dead, but with much ado obtain'd a homely Monument in his Native Soil.</p>

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:51478:109"/> or forgotten; ſo he receiv'd it with ſuch inward indignation as ſhew'd he only pardon'd what he could not puniſh: But it appear'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards that it was not in the young Rebels power to give back the life he had proceeded ſo near taking away, for the wound in his Spirit was ſo much deeper then any of thoſe on his Body, that it could never be cured, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver skin'd over, bleeding inwardly unperceiv'd till he died; which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it were not long after, yet he out liv'd moſt of thoſe great men that were Actors with him in his Undertakings, and left not the world till he had ſufficiently requited the King of <hi>France</hi> for this unpardonable injury of ſeducing his Son, taking a ſlight occaſion from a Jeſt, to ſhew how much he was in Earneſt in his Revenge.

Thus ended this great Conqueror, and with him all his Greatneſs, being left by all the World almoſt as ſoon as he left it; not only by thoſe to whom he had given a livelyhood, but by thoſe to whom he had given life, every one of them forſaking him, to ſcramble for what he left: his eldeſt Son haſtned away to take poſſeſſion of his Dutchy of <hi>Normandy;</hi> his ſecond Son to Inveſt himſelf in his Kingdom of <hi>England;</hi> only he to whom providentially he had left no home, was the man ſtayed to bring him to his long home; which yet could not be done without much diſaſter and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption: for as 'twas three dayes before his Body was mov'd from the place where he dyed, ſo 'twas twice three before his Son <hi>Henry</hi> could get any to undertake the conveying it to <hi>Cane,</hi> where 'twas to be buried: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it came there, 'twas left the ſecond time alone in the ſtreet by thoſe that carried it, who took occaſion, it ſeems, to run all away to quench a Fire that broke out of a Houſe by which they were to paſs; and being with all this ado brought afterward to his Grave, one ſtept forth and forbid the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terment, till they compounded for the Ground he was to be buried in. Thus like that great Conqueror, who thought the World too little to contain him whilſt he liv'd, but being dead could ſcarce obtain ſo much Earth as to cover his naked Corps; it was accounted no ſmall part of his, as of the others happineſs, that he met with a Grave at laſt.</p>

               <p>Theſe three brave Sons ſtanding thus, as it were in a Triangle, at the death of their Father, equidiſtant one from the other, without any viſible diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion in Power, Parts, or Reputation: the firſt repreſenting him as he was a King, the other as Duke, and the third as Conqueror, which made them alike Obſtinate, Ambitious, and Emulous of each others Glory, 'tis no marvel that the Feuds betwixt themſelves only took up all the action of their time, and left no room for any other Competitors to come in betwixt them: But that which ſeems more rare, is the viciſſitude of their love and hate, each of them, as his ſquint-eyed intereſt mov'd him to change his ground, retaining ſtill the affections of a Brother, even whilſt he acted as an Enemy. For firſt the younger aſſiſted the elder againſt the middle Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; then the middle compounded with the elder, to be reveng'd on the younger Brother; after this again the younger reconciles himſelf to his middle Brother in order to obtaining ſatisfaction from the elder, who after this agreed with the middle (as he before with him) to fall both upon the younger Brother; in the laſt place they all united and agreed but upon ſuch terms, that their Union ſet them worſe at variance then before; ſo that every one of them ſtood off, and acted ſingly for himſelf, each againſt other, and each againſt two: In concluſion, the elder was diſpoſſeſs'd by the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Brother, and he forc'd by death to yield up all to the younger; and ſo they inherited their Fathers Lands, he only his Fortune; but all were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:51478:110"/> Inheritors of his Troubles, who has this Remark upon him, That he never had reſt living or dead; his Bones being divided, as well as his Children; each part of his Dominions claiming a ſhare of them, as each of his Sons of theſe.</p>
               <p>Having viewed them thus together, let us look upon this King ſingle; who, however he is drawn but with an half face, like one of the <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to have been the moſt like his Father of all the Brothers, there being no other difference betwixt them but this, that the one was alwayes a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, t'other never conquer'd: For as he had his Fathers Courage to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter Dangers, ſo he had his wiſdom and readineſs of mind to extricate himſelf out of them, and ever fell like a Cube upon his bottom, let For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune hurl him whither ſhe would, making his Enemies glad to be his Friends, when all the Friends he had, almoſt were become his Enemies; ſtanding ſo firmly, even whiles he was forced to take in the points of as many Swords as had been before drawn upon his Father, that nothing could move him. The firſt that ſet upon him was his Brother <hi>Robert,</hi> who (as if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to look him in the face) tamper'd with thoſe neareſt in Truſt about him, to wound him in the back, before he came to cloſe grapple with him; or rather tried, if poſſible, to ſpring a Mine under his Throne, whilſt he began his Battery at farther diſtance: Principal Engineer in this Plot was his diſcontented Uncle <hi>Odo</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Bayeulx,</hi> who deſigning to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige both <hi>Normans</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> to conſpire with him, took in the firſt by declaring to ſet up their beloved Duke <hi>Robert</hi> for life; and deceived the laſt by promiſing to ſettle the Reverſion of the Soveraignty on their Darling Prince <hi>Edgar,</hi> whom therefore he put into the hands of Duke <hi>Robert,</hi> for the Security (as he pretended) of both: <hi>Robert</hi> receiving him as his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mager, and <hi>Edgar</hi> looking on him as his Protector; whilſt <hi>Odo</hi> pleas'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with having both within his own reach, whenever he ſaw cauſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare for himſelf.</p>
               <p>This Storm ſpread it ſelf very wide; for <hi>Odo</hi> fortify'd in <hi>Kent,</hi> where he might be aſſiſted by the King of <hi>France</hi> if need were: <hi>William</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Durham</hi> ingaged all the Northern Countries, where they might expect help from the King of <hi>Scots:</hi> others ſecur'd <hi>Herefordſhire, Shropſhire,</hi> and <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſterſhire,</hi> where they might readily have aid from the <hi>Welch;</hi> whilſt <hi>Roger Mountgomery</hi> rais'd up <hi>Norfolk, Suffolk,</hi> and <hi>Cambridgeſhire,</hi> and <hi>Hugh de Grandmenill</hi> led up thoſe of <hi>Leiceſterſhire</hi> and <hi>Northamptonſhire</hi> to face him. This as it was the beſt formed, ſo it was the moſt formidable Rebellion we meet with in all our Story, founded on ſuch ſure grounds, and managed by ſuch ſure men, that King <hi>Williams</hi> Councel could not tell where to begin, nor whither to turn them: but he himſelf being as quick of apprehenſion as of action, takes the meaſure of his hopes from that of their fears, and whilſt they judg'd it hard to repreſs them, becauſe they were thus divided, he took that advantage to break them like ſingle ſticks, as he found them lye ſcatter'd one from the other; who, had they been united under one Bond, could not have been ſo eaſily confounded. After which he heal'd the wounds he gave them, by gentle Lenitives, relaxing their Tributes, remitting their Priviledges, and indulging them to that degree, as never any King before him did; by which means he prevail'd with the very ſame men to carry the War into <hi>Normandy,</hi> whereby wounding his Brother <hi>Robert</hi> with the very Arrows taken out of his own Quiver, and the ſame which he had directed againſt him, it appears how much he had the better of him in point of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, as well as of Power. This breach with the elder, gave him the firſt occaſion of breaking with his younger Brother; for having a ſtrong
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:51478:110"/> Army on foot, Duke <hi>Robert</hi> after his having concluded a diſhonourable Peace with him, deſir'd his aid in reducing the Caſtle of <hi>Mount St. Michael,</hi> detain'd from him by Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> who being not paid the money he had lent him to carry on the War againſt King <hi>William</hi> (for <hi>Robert</hi> had pawn'd to him the Country of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> but afterwards took it away again) ſeiz'd upon this Caſtle, in hope, by the help of ſome <hi>Britains</hi> he had hired to ſerve him for his Money, to have done himſelf right: but <hi>Robert</hi> made this advantage of the diſ-advantage King <hi>William</hi> had brought upon him, to ingage him in reducing t'other unhappy Prince, that doing a kindneſs to one, loſt both his Brothers; the one taking offence at his demand, t'other at the Occaſion; whereby both ſet upon him at once, and beſieging him forty dayes, brought him to the point of yeilding: but the ſame evil Spirit that firſt divided them to do more miſchief, did this good to unite them again, working upon the good Nature of Duke <hi>Robert,</hi> and the ill Nature of King <hi>William,</hi> the ſame effect: for upon his Submiſſion, <hi>William</hi> to be revenged on <hi>Robert,</hi> for having entertain'd his Competitor <hi>Atheling,</hi> judg'd <hi>Henry</hi> to be ſatisfied his Debt by a day certain, out of thoſe very Lands which the other had aſſign'd to <hi>Atheling</hi> for a Penſion; upon which <hi>Robert</hi>'s pity turn'd immediately into ſpight, and when <hi>Henry</hi> came for his Money, he clap'd him up in Priſon, and kept him in Dureſs till he releas'd the Debt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> complaining of this Injuſtice to the King of <hi>France</hi> (his Brother <hi>William</hi> being then return'd into <hi>England</hi>) was by him put into Arms again; and by the ſurprizing the Caſtle of <hi>Damfront,</hi> recover'd back moſt of his Security, with all the Country of <hi>Paſſais</hi> beſides. <hi>Robert</hi> hereupon pleads that King <hi>William</hi> had fail'd of paying him in certain Sums of Money, due by promiſe to ſatisfie <hi>Henry,</hi> and that by reaſon of this failure he could not perform with him; and to ſatisfie himſelf for the Damages done him by this pretended breach of <hi>Williams,</hi> he fell upon King <hi>William</hi>'s Caſtles: This drew him over the ſecond time, whether to right Prince <hi>Henry</hi> or himſelf, was not declar'd; who putting on a Vizard of Indignation to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright Duke <hi>Robert,</hi> as if he had intended nothing leſs then the Conqueſt of all <hi>Normandy,</hi> ſends back into <hi>England</hi> for an Army of 30000 to joyn with thoſe Forces he had there; by the fame whereof having done more then perhaps any body could with the men themſelves, if they had arriv'd, he ſent private Orders to his General, being then at the Water-ſide, to diſmiſs every man that would lay down ten ſhillings: by which queint trick of State, never practiſed before, he rais'd ſo great a Sum, as not only ſerv'd to pay the King of <hi>France</hi> his Bribe, for not aſſiſting his Brother <hi>Robert,</hi> and to defray his own preſent charge, but in effect to purchaſe all <hi>Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> which thereupon was Mortgaged to him by <hi>Robert,</hi> to furniſh himſelf for that great Expedition of recovering the Holy Land from the Infidels: An Undertaking politickly recommended by <hi>Urban</hi> the Second, to all ſuch Princes as he fear'd, or had a mind to fool, as ſo meritorious a work, that it was indeed (as he repreſented the matter) a kind of taking Heaven by Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, whereby he ſo wrought upon the eaſie Faith of that Active and Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Age, that without any great difficulty he prevail'd with them to caſt themſelves under a voluntary Oſtraciſme, whilſt himſelf, and thoſe that were Parties in that holy Cheat (imbarazed in a Conteſt with the Emperor about Superiority) were deliver'd from the men of Power and Credit they moſt ſuſpected to take part with him; and by the purchaſe of their Eſtates and Seigniories, greatly inriched the Church af erward.</p>
               <p>King <hi>William</hi> thus happily rid of his elder Brother (who as I ſaid before had pawn'd his own Land, to recover that for the Church) was at leiſure to
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:51478:111"/> return home to make even all reckonings with his elder Enemy the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> by whoſe death and his Sons (both kill'd in the act of Invaſion) he made himſelf ſo far Maſter of their Country, as to compel them to accept a King from him, who having ſerv'd him in his Wars, and being for that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice prefer'd by him, they durſt not yet refuſe, though they might reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly expect he would be alwayes at his Devotion. This made the King of <hi>France</hi> ſo jealous of his growing Greatneſs, that to prevent his coming over Sea again, he tamper'd with the diſcontented <hi>Norman</hi> Nobility to ſet up <hi>Stephen</hi> E. of <hi>Albemarle,</hi> his Fathers Siſters Son, upon what pretence of Right appears not, but he whoſe manner 'twas to meet danger, and not tarry till it found him out, prevented the Conſpiracy by ſeizing on the chief Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators, <hi>Mowbray, d'Ou,</hi> and <hi>d'Alveric,</hi> who being the firſt Examples of his Severity, were ſo cruelly treated, that if any men could be ſaid to be murther'd by the Sword of Juſtice they were; but the Ill of this Severity had that good effect, that this firſt Inſtance of his Cruelty made it the laſt occaſion to him to ſhew it, ſo that from that time all War ceaſing, he betook himſelf to the pleaſures of Peace.</p>
               <p>And now deeming himſelf moſt ſecure, he met with an unavoidable (I cannot ſay unexpected) Fate, for, like <hi>Caeſar</hi> his Parallel, he had ſufficient warning of it both by his own and his Friends Dreams the night before; the Nature whereof was ſuch as he could not but contemn it, becauſe he could not underſtand it; and having never been daunted by his Enemies, he was aſham'd to ſeem now afraid of himſelf: however, the perplexity of his thoughts diſorder'd him ſo far, that in deſpight of his natural Courage (which was perhaps as great as ever any mans was) he could not find in his heart to go out all the morning of that day he was kill'd: and at Dinner (which argued ſome failure of his Spirits) he drank more freely then his uſual cuſtome was, that accelerated his Fate by taking off his Caution: ſo that after Dinner he would needs go hunt in the <hi>New Forreſt,</hi> and taking his Bow to ſhoot a Deer in that ominous place, where before a<note n="*" place="margin">His Brother <hi>Richard.</hi>

               <p>Being thus quietly ſtated, he ſweetned his Government by taking off all Taxes, to ſhew his Beneficence; and ſome of the principal Taxers, to ſhew his Juſtice: By the firſt he pleas'd the Multitude, in point of Relief; by the other the better ſort, in point of Envy and Revenge; gratifying their Spleen, by ſacrificing the griping Biſhop of <hi>Durham;</hi> a man, who being rais'd from a baſe Condition by baſer means, had attained to the honour of being Chief Miniſter to his Brother King <hi>William,</hi> and was grown learn'd in the Science of ſelling Juſtice; by the diſtribution of whoſe Bribes, he brib'd thoſe whom he thought fit to make his own Miniſters: neither thought it he enough to be an Engliſh man himſelf, without aſſuring the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:51478:112"/> State that he intended all his Poſterity ſhould be ſo too: and therefore, to the end to make ſure the wiſe men, that were as apt to be jealous, as the weaker ſort to be querulous, he married <hi>Maud,</hi> Siſter to the Scotch King, and Daughter to <hi>Margaret,</hi> Siſter to <hi>Edgar Atheling,</hi> the right Heir of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Blood: a Lady that brought him an Inheritance of Goodneſs from her Mother, and a good Title of Inheritance from her Uncle.</p>
               <p>Thus firmly did he intrench himſelf before his Brother (whom he had made a King in fame only, that he might the eaſier make himſelf a real one) return'd home; who arriving unlook'd for, was welcom'd by the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Normandy</hi> with more then ordinary Joy: by whom being inform'd of what was done in <hi>England,</hi> he made it the buſineſs of the firſt year, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide an Army, and in the ſecond landed it at <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> in order to the recovery of his loſt Right: whereof he was the more aſſur'd, in reſpect of thoſe of the <hi>Norman</hi> Nobility here, as he thought inclin'd to him, who mov'd with revenge or diſcontent, would be glad of any Occaſion to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt: This, as it was a ſtorm King <hi>Henry</hi> ſaw at a diſtance, ſo he provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſo well for it, by cutting off all Aſſiſtances, that Duke <hi>Robert</hi> and thoſe with him, doubting the ſucceſs, and ſeeing themſelves certainly loſt, if they prevail'd not (it being in his power to fight them where he pleas'd, and when) upon his deſire to ſave the effuſion of Chriſtian Blood, yielded to Articles of Peace; the Subſtance whereof was this, That <hi>Henry</hi> being born after his Father was rightfully King, and being now inveſted in the Crown by act of the Kingdom, ſhould enjoy the ſame during life, and pay <hi>Robert</hi> 3000 Marks <hi>per Annum,</hi> as an Earneſt of the Reverſion after his Death, in caſe <hi>Robert</hi> out-liv'd him.</p>
               <p>With theſe Conditions <hi>Robert</hi> rather blinded then ſatisfied, returns back again into his own Country; and it had been well if he had never been blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed otherwiſe: But ſuch is the frenzie of Ambition, that it ſuffers not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Princes to conſider either what they ought to do, or what to ſuffer, whilſt like the Superior Orbs, they are hurried with reſtleſs Motion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out underſtanding by what Intelligences they are actuated. Finding himſelf fallen from the height of his Expectation, into ſome degree of Contempt with his own Subjects, he aſſai'd by Profuſion (which ſome call Liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) to raiſe his Reputation, at leaſt to diſguiſe his Impotency, ſpending ſo freely, that the Nobility fearing the Revenues of the Dutchy would not ſuffice to ſupport his vanity, complain'd thereof to King <hi>Henry;</hi> who, to ſhew his own power and t'others weakneſs, ſent for him over to chide him, and indeed reprehended him ſo ſharply, as if he had been his Father, and not his Brother; and as if he would have him to know, he rather expected the Reverſion of the Dukedome after his death, then to be accomptable to him for the Kingdom after his own: and whether it were that he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him with a Detention of his Penſion, or drew him, being of a yielding Nature (as moſt indigent men are) to give him a releaſe for ſome inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Sum of ready Mony, is not certain: but ſo it was, that upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, he could no longer conceal the indignation he had conceived at it, but took the very firſt Occaſion to ſhew it by joyning himſelf with ſome mutinous Lords, who having before begun an unſucceſsful Combuſtion in <hi>England,</hi> had fled over thither, to commit what Outrages they could there.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> for a while pretended himſelf touch'd in Conſcience with the foulneſs of a Fraternal War, but was indeed apprehenſive that ſuch tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial Injuries, as the taking a few Caſtles, was not worthy the trouble of drawing him over in Perſon, at leaſt not worth the charge of entring into
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:51478:112"/> ſuch a War as might juſtifie the requiring his Dukedom for a ſatisfaction; but having let them alone till he believ'd his ſufferance had elevated them beyond the temper of hearkning to any conditions, he then took his time to chaſtiſe their folly, and by one ſingle Battle, upon the very ſame day, and in the very ſame manner (as 'tis reported) that his Father juſt forty years before won <hi>England,</hi> he won <hi>Normandy:</hi> and having made his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther priſoner, depriv'd him firſt of his liberty, after of his country, and laſtly of that which was dearer than either, the light of his Eyes; requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his attempt (which was but natural) to eſcape out of priſon, with a puniſhment that was of all other moſt unnatural, and as much beyond death, as it was ſhort of it; which inhumanity to his brother, though it was perhaps but a juſt judgment from Heaven upon him for his inhumanity to his Father, whoſe life he had twice attempted, being wilfully blinded by the King of <hi>France;</hi> yet 'twas ſuch as was altogether undeſerv'd, as from him: for t'other had him faſt enough within his power, circumſcrib'd by all the rules of Hoſtility, beſieged within a Fort, and half ſtarv'd; he was ſo far from preſſing upon him, that he pittied him, and broke with his brother Friend to ſave his brother Enemy.</p>
               <p>Poor Prince <hi>Robert,</hi> how was he betraied by the goodneſs of his own Nature, and tempted like a Child to ſave the bird which was to pick out his Eyes? How did he live to ſee himſelf buried before he was dead? invelop'd in dark and diſmal thoughts, whilſt he contemplated his Sons loſs with more affliction than his own: a forward Prince born to two Crowns, but now reduc'd to that neceſſity to borrow one to buy him bread. So long as it ſerv'd the King of <hi>France</hi> his turn to ſerve him, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd him in that Court (adverſity knows no other Friends, nor upon other Terms:) But King <hi>Henry</hi> by his mony quickly took him off; and Heaven to requite the good turn not long after took off him, for whom all this was done; puniſhing his unjuſt detaining the livelihood of his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Nephew <hi>William,</hi> with taking away the life of his own innocent Son <hi>William,</hi> the only hope of his Family, who being ſhipwrackt in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn out of <hi>Normandy</hi> with a hundred and fifty Paſſengers more, amongſt whom was his beloved Siſter the Counteſs of <hi>Perch,</hi> indeavouring to ſave her, loſt himſelf.</p>
               <p>This Clap of Judgment coming in a Calm of glory, when all the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſling of his Ambition ſeem'd to be paſs'd over, ſo overwhelm'd the Joys of his paſt ſucceſſes, that as if his Conſcience had ſhrunk at the horror of ſeeing his oppreſſion and ſupplantation ſo repaid, with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of that for which he drew all this guilt upon himſelf; 'tis ſaid that from that time he never was ſeen to laugh more: and however he ſtrugled with Deſtiny for more Iſſue Male, marrying not long after a moſt vertuous and beautiful young Lady, yet all was in vain: The invenom'd Arrow ſtuck ſtill in his Liver, and for want of other Heirs, he was forced to faſten the ſucceſſion on his Daughter <hi>Maud,</hi> who being intangled in his fate, and as apparently Planet-ſtruck as himſelf, could never attain to be a Queen, however a Dutcheſs, and an Empreſs; being diſappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by one, that had leſs right, and not ſo good pretence, as her own Father. And as the main Line of <hi>Normandy</hi> fail'd in him, that was but the third Inheritor, ſo the ſucceſſion ever ſince proved ſo brittle, that it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver held to the third Heir in a right deſcent, without being put by, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving ſome alteration by uſurpation, or extinction of the Male blood, which (ſaith mine Author) may teach Princes to let men alone with their Rights, and God with his Providence.</p>
               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:51478:113"/>
               <p>But ſuch is the unhappineſs of Kings that they either underſtand not Deſtiny ſo well as private Men, or cannot ſo readily ſubmit to it, and as Ambition is a reſtleſs paſſion, which however it may be ſometimes weary, never tires; ſo it urges them to be ſtill preſſing upon Fortune with hopes to compel or corrupt her; hoping that if ſhe will not be ſerviceable to them, ſhe may at leaſt not oppoſe them. He found that this rent at home had crack'd all the chain of his courſes in <hi>France</hi> (whoſe King took part with his Nephew <hi>William</hi>) whilſt his two great Friends, <hi>Foulk</hi> Earl of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jou,</hi> and <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Mellent</hi> declared againſt him. Yet urg'd by his natural diligence or deſire of Rule he could not but ſtill puſh on, till by the death of that unfortunate youth before mention'd, all the hopes of his Brother <hi>Robert</hi> periſhed, and came to be entirely his: yet neither then could he take any Reſt, though he had no body to give him any diſquiet, his Conſcience keeping him waking with continual Alarums, without any kind of ſleep but what was ſo disturbed and diſorderly, as declar'd to the whole World all was not well within. Often did he riſe out of his Bed in the Night, and catching up his Sword put himſelf into a Poſture of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence as againſt ſome Perſonal aſſault: and ſometimes in company he would catch hold of his Servants hands, as apprehending they were about to draw upon him. Thus was he dog'd with continued fears, and thoſe ſuch as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps were Prophetical of what follow'd: that ſome body ſhould ſtart up (as immediately after there did) who taking Example from himſelf, ſhould Spurn his aſhes, and uſurp as much upon his Innocent Daughter and her Son, as he himſelf had done upon his innocent Brother and his Son.</p>

               <p>The Breach at which ſhe firſt entred was made by King <hi>Stephen</hi> himſelf, who foreſeeing the approaching miſchief, drew on the evil he would avoid by the ſame way he thought to prevent it: for ſuſpecting the Caſtles he had permitted to be new built, with purpoſe to have broken the force of any over-running Invaſion, might now as well become receptacles to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse Party; he commanded them to be deliver'd up into his hands for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the publick Peace. This begat a general murmure, that a diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the proprietors, whereof thoſe of moſt note being Clergy-men, and Lords of great power and ſtomach, preſuming upon the Obligation he had to the Church, which (as they ſaid) advanced him to the Crown without any military help, refus'd ſo give up their Keys into the hands of Laymen, upon whom as they thought he had not the like tie of honour nor honeſty as upon themſelves. Hereupon the Legate interpos'd, who holding himſelf nearer allied to his Brother Prelates than to his Brother King, urg'd the queſtion of priviledg ſo far, that 'twas thought there wanted nothing but an opportunity to ſhew they could more willingly quit their Allegiance (as they had done their Liberty) than their poſſeſſions: for King <hi>Stephen</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their refuſal to obey his Order, clapt up ſeveral of them in priſon. This opportunity <hi>Maud</hi> by her arrival rather gave than took, when ſhe made up the Crie, and joyn'd her claim with theirs, and thereby made the War to be felt before it was perceiv'd: which ſpread it ſelf like a burning Feaver through all the veins of the body politick, but raged by Fits only; it ſo happening that they were not ſeldom parted by the ſaid new built Caſtles they conteſted for; many of which ſtanding neuter give ſtops to their Fury, as if intended by Providence to allay their heat till it were tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate enough to admit of ſome Parley: but that proving ineffectual, like Game-cocks, aftertaking breath they fell to it afreſh with equal force and equal confidence, the whole Nation being divided betwixt them according to their ſeveral intereſt for affections, ſome taking part with her, others with him; theſe to diſcharge their Conſciences, thoſe their honour, ſome to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance their fortunes, others to ſecure their advancements.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Stephen</hi> gave every where proof of his courage; ſhe of her wiſdom; both of their diligence; either perhaps worthy a greater Empire than they contended for; but whilſt the Body politick thus miſerably tormented
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:51478:114"/> with the convulſions of Might and Right languiſh'd under the growing diſtemper, behold a ſudden change which ſeem'd the more mortal, for that the grief ſeiz'd upon the head: The King is taken priſoner, with whoſe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty one would have thought all the hopes of that ſide had been loſt; but it ſo hapned that the Feminine Victor found herſelf ingag'd in a more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Conteſt with one of her own Sex, and as of the ſame ſpirit, ſo of the ſame name. King Stephen's Wife takes up the Sword whilſt her husband continues a priſoner, who not looking that Fortune ſhould fall into her lap, was ſo induſtrious to catch it, and heading her husbands Forces, ſhe brought the Title to a ſecond trial with ſo much better ſucceſs than he, that the victorious Empreſs was forc'd to give place to the more victorious Queen, and ſo hardly eſcaped that to ſave her life ſhe was content to be reckon'd amongſt the dead, being carried off in a Coffin as if ſhe had been kill'd, and ſo forc'd to leave him a priſoner behind, that was indeed the life of her Cauſe, the Earl of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> her Brother, and her General, whoſe liberty being ſet againſt that of the Kings, both ſides became even again in the liſt of their fatal Contention.</p>
               <p>And now the Kings Party labours to recover what they had loſt: thoſe of the Empreſs her Faction ſtrove only to keep what they had gain'd, till both having tired out and almoſt baffled the Courage of their partakers at home ſought for recruits abroad: <hi>Maud</hi> ſends into <hi>Normandy,</hi> the King into <hi>Flanders;</hi> each ſide ſeems to fright from this time forward, not ſo much for Victory as Revenge. But whilſt they fright the people with a noiſe of their great preparations the bubble of expectation (ſwollen to its full height) broak, and the hopes of either ſide ſunk ſo low by the death of Prince <hi>Euſtace</hi> Son and Heir to the King, and that of the Earl of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pillar which ſupported the Empreſs; this the party by whom, that the party for whom the War was firſt begun, not to ſay miantain'd, that they concluded a Peace for want of ſtrength rather than of ſtomach, all things ending as they began, by determination of the free vote of the people; who in an open Parliament at <hi>Wincheſter</hi> parted the Stakes as evenly as they could, giving to King <hi>Stephen</hi> the Crown during life, to <hi>Henry</hi> Son of <hi>Maud</hi> (and as ſome think by him) the reverſion expectant after his death, who if he were not his Natural was thereupon made his adopted Son: and ſo end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the troubles of this King, which ſeem to have been ſo agreeable to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that as ſoon as they ceaſed, he ceaſed to live; ſurviving the War no longer than juſt to take leave of his Friends, being evicted by an <hi>Ejectione firmâ</hi> brought againſt him by Fate to let in the Son of his Enemy, after he had held the poſſeſſion (notwitſtanding the continual Interruption given him) nineteen years with great proſperity though little or no peace: wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thoſe many works of Piety done by himſel or others in his time, there being more Inſtances of that Nature during his ſhort Raign, than had been in many years before.</p>

               <p>He was the firſt King of the <hi>Plantaginets,</hi> and began his Raign, as the Great <hi>Solomon</hi> (who was near about his Age) did his, with the choice of wiſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors, to take off all objections againſt his youth; with the expulſion of all Strangers, to take off all objections againſt his being a forrainer; with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of all aliened Crown Lands, to take of the fear as well as the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Taxes: which as it increas'd his reputation no leſs than his reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, ſo he pleas'd many with diſguſting but a few. After this he pluck'd down all thoſe Caſtles which being erected by King <hi>Stephen</hi>'s permiſſion, had proved the nurſeries of the late rebellion, and he did it with the leſs cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, in reſpect the people thought it contributed as much to their quiet, as to his own. Laſtly by expelling thoſe falſe Lords, that contrary to their oath given to his Mother, took part with the Uſurper <hi>Stephen,</hi> he at once ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd his Revenge, and confirm'd the opinion conceiv'd of his Juſtice and Piety.</p>
               <p>Thus having got the ſtart in point of honour, as well as of Riches, of all the neighbour Princes his Contemporaries; one would have thought ſo proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous a beginning muſt have concluded with as proſperous an ending: but it ſell out quite otherwiſe; for to the reſt of his Greatneſs was added that of having great troubles, and troubles of that durance as ended not
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:51478:115"/> but with his life. Nor could it well be otherwiſe, for he was of a reſtleſs ſpirit, ſeldome without an Army, ſeldomer without an Enemy, but never without an Occaſion to provoke one; for he was a great ingroſſer of glory, whereby being neceſſitated to ſet himſelf againſt every one, every one ſet themſelves againſt him: and the confederations againſt him were ſo well timed that in one day they invaded him in <hi>England, Normandy, Acquitain,</hi> and <hi>Britain:</hi> but that which made his unhappineſs ſeem ſingular was, that the greateſt part of his Enemies were thoſe of his greateſt Friends; I mean not ſuch as were of remoter relations, as ſubjects, ſervants, confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, or allies, &amp;c. but thoſe of neareſt propinquity; his brother, his wife, his own children, ſuch as were fleſh of his fleſh, and bone of his bone: ſo that he could not poſſibly ſight for himſelf without fighting againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; like thoſe who to preſerve life are conſtrain'd to diſmember them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: wherein the malice of his Fate ſeem'd to exceed that of his Foes, whiles it drew more croſs lines over his Actions than Nature had drawn over his Face; rendring all his undertakings ſo diſaſterous, that even when he had the beſt on't, he ſeem'd yet to have the worſt on it, and loſt his honour though he got his enterprize. Thus when he recover'd the Earldome of <hi>Northumberland</hi> from <hi>David</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> and the Dukedom of <hi>Anjou</hi> from his brother <hi>Geoffry,</hi> the firſt by the power of his Wiſdom, the laſt by the wiſe management of his power (both which conteſts ended not without giving to each of them full ſatisfaction for their pretentions) yet one brought upon him the clamor of injuſtice, t'other the ſcandal of Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice: two vices ill beſeeming any man, worſe a King. So in the diſpute he had with the Earl of St. <hi>Giles</hi> about the County of <hi>Tholoſſe,</hi> which was his Right, though t'others Poſſeſſion, he was fain to ask peace of one that he knew was unable to carry on the War; and after he brought him to his own terms, was himſelf ſo hamper'd with the ſame Fetters he put upon him, that in concluſion he ſuffer'd no leſs in the opinion of his wiſdom than he had before in that of his power. So when he married his Son <hi>Henry</hi> to the daughter of his great Enemy, the King of <hi>France,</hi> with a prudent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of being reconcil'd to him in a nearer combination, he found that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of keeping him out of his Territories (which was all he had to care for before the Match) he had now let him into his Houſe, to do him more miſchief with leſs difficulty (there being more danger by his undermining than battering) whiles himſelf permitted the pit to be made in which the foundation of his Sons greatneſs was to be laid; to whom having given too early an expectation of his Kingdom (by allowing him the title of King) without being able to give him the Grace to tarry for his death, he found (when 'twas too late) that a Crown was no eſtate to be made over in Truſt: yet this he did not by chance, neither as one tranſported by any Fatherly fondneſs, but out of a provident care to ſettle the Succeſſion, and as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably to fix his Sons Ambition. Neither was his ſeverity to his younger Sons leſs fatal to him than his indulgence to his Elder; whilſt thinking to recover the power he loſt there, by keeping a ſtricter hand over thoſe here, he was bereft of them too by the ſame way he thought to make them more ſurer to him: for as the eldeſt by having ſo much, was eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded there was more due to him; ſo the younger brothers believing they ought to have had ſomething more than they had, becauſe their elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had ſo much more than he ſhould, preſs'd him out of neceſſity, as much as t'other out of wantonneſs. This looking ſo like a judgment from heaven, gave both the world and himſelf ſo full a view of his fate and his failings, that from this time he began ſenſibly to languiſh under the grief and

               </p>
               <p>But that which made the troubles of his own houſe more inſupportable, was the meeting with as great troubles in Gods houſe; where the diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his Children was out-vied by the contempt of a ſervant: who advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by deſtiny to make a mock of Majeſty, finding a purpoſe in him to cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail the growing greatneſs of the Clergy (that was arriv'd to that height, that they were able to make a King without a Title, and might (as he ſuſpected) by tampering with Poſterity be able in time to ſet up a Title without a King) reſolv'd to wreſtle both ſingle, and to compare authority: and however he knew the deſign to be ſo well backt by the envy of the Laiety, that the Pope himſelf and all the Conclave deſpair'd of weathering it; yet ſuch was his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy, having got the help of opinion, and the belief of Integrity on his ſide, that he ſtood the breach of this unhappy Kings Indignation, and defied his Thunderbolt, till the very minute it blaſted him; by whoſe death every one thought the King had got the better of it, in that he had the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a full Revenge, without being touch'd with the guilt (ſince thoſe that murther'd him however they did it to pleaſe the King, did it yet without his knowledg or privity.) But ſuch was the Tyranny of Fate, that he who in his life time only made him how, being dead brought him upon his knees, and forced him to acknowledg him as much above his faith afterwards, as he was above his will before: and (then which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be more unfortunate) for the very ſame cauſe he proſecuted him in his life time as a Traitour, being dead, he ador'd him as a Saint.</p>
               <p>It were too troubleſome to tell of all the troubles of this great Prince, much more to bring them into any method, which coming from himſelf, and not ending (as I ſaid before) but with himſelf, however they ſeem'd to vary in the Lines, kept ſtill in the circle of his Family, mov'd by the ſame Cauſes though not by the ſame Perſons: for as his Son <hi>Henry</hi> before, ſo his Son <hi>Richard</hi> afterwards, was tempted to capitulate with him, and to ſhew the world he was his Brothers ſucceſſor, in point of diſobedience as well as of right, he did with as great ambition, but greater paſſion, require an aſſurance of the ſame Kingdom and the ſame Wife: both equally dear to the Father, both alike fatal to the Sons; wherein meeting with a denial, the preſent fit of Love that was upon him heightened into an extream of hatred; with the contagion whereof (for it ran in a blood) his brother <hi>John</hi> was not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter infected: and ſo joyning together, they made the laſt Effort upon their now almoſt tired fathers patience, beſieging him in the beloved Town where his Father was buried and himſelf born; which he not long after took from him, and in it her that was dearer to him than his life, the fair Lady <hi>Adela</hi> (now become the old Kings avowed Miſtreſs, however affianc'd before to his Son <hi>Richard.</hi>) This as it was an indignity that flaw'd his great heart at one ſingle ſtroak, and wounded his ſpirit beyond all recovery, ſo the loſs of the City provok'd him to blaſpheme God, and the loſs of the Lady to curſe all his poſterity, and what ſence nature retain'd of the loſs of his life (that took away the ſence of all other loſſes) appears by the intelligence it held with his revenge after death: which over-acting its part (if I may ſo ſay) to charge the guilt upon the unnatural offender, forced the blood out of his noſtrils as he lay bare-fac'd upon his hearſe, as ſoon as his Son <hi>Richard</hi> (the murtherer) approach'd with diſſembled reverence to kiſs his hand.

               <p>And wherefore was all this toyl and charge, imbaraſing himſelf and his Subjects, but only to hold up the vain-glorious reputation of his Courage, and make good that Beſtial Adjunct of <hi>Coeur de Leon</hi> which was not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly given to him, if we conſider that the ſame Creature is as much noted for his Voracity as Courage; yet was the exceſs of his Valour moſtly ſpent in private quarrels; the King of <hi>France,</hi> who was ingaged with like Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and he falling together by the Ears as ſoon as they met in <hi>Scicily;</hi> and after he came into the Holy Land he had the like quarrel with the Arch-Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> with both upon the ſame point of Precedence, though not with like reaſon; the other having out-brav'd him in the common Cauſe, and planted his Colours upon the Walls of <hi>Acon</hi> before him, which he plucking down in ſcorn, t'other made him vail Bonnet to it, that is, ſurrender up his Cap of Maintenance (as 'twas then call'd) as a Pledge of his Homage to the Emperor when he acknowledg'd him his Supream Lord. And what was the end of this great Enterprize, after having tarried above a year there, but the taking only one Town, and beſieging another, which upon notice of the Diſorders at home (that a wiſe man might eaſily have foreſeen and preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) he quit with no leſs diſorder, leaving the whole Action with as much precipitation as he took it up; inſomuch that his Wife and Siſter that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied him, and all their Attendants and Officers were forc'd to ſhift for themſelves, and get home as they could; which Inconſideration of his met with that pitiful Event before mention'd, to redeem him from which, his People were fain to ſtrain themſelves beyond their abilities, Lay-men and Clergy parting with a fourth part of their Real, and a tenth of their Perſonal Eſtate, all not being ſufficient to make up his Ranſome, till they
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:51478:118"/> pawn'd and ſold their very Chalices and Church Ornaments.</p>
               <p>Being thus as it were un-king'd, and expos'd naked to the Vulgar, ſtript of his Honour as well as Treaſure, he thought himſelf not ſecure of the fai h and reverence due to his birth by any other way but a Recoronation, which being as extraordinary as the reſt of his Actions (for he's the firſt we meet with twice crown'd) was notwithſtanding the poverty of the Nation, that had paid in two years time no leſs then jj hundred thouſand Marks of Silver (the vaſtneſs of which Sum may be gueſs'd at by the Standard of thoſe Times, when twenty pence was more then a Crown now) perform'd with that ſolemnity, as ſhew'd he had the ſame mind, though not the ſame purſe, as when he began his great Adventures. After this he fitted out a Fleet of 100 Sail of Ships to carry him into <hi>Normandy,</hi> to chaſtize the Rebellions of his Brother <hi>John,</hi> who incouraged by the King of <hi>France</hi> (the conſtant Enemy of <hi>England</hi>) had, during his abſence, depos'd his Vice-roy <hi>Long-champ,</hi> and forc'd him to lay down his Legatine Croſs, to take up that of the holy War, and had put himſelf in ſo good forwardneſs to depoſe him too (having brought the People to ſwear a Conditional Fealty to him) that there wanted nothing to give him poſſeſſion of the Crown which was before ſecur'd in Reverſion but the conſent of the Emperor, to whom there was offer'd a Bribe of 150 thouſand Marks to detain him, or 1000 pounds a Month, as long as he kept him Priſoner. But ſuch was the power of the Mother, who was alwaies a faſt Friend to the younger Brother, and had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a greater ſhare in the Government of the elder, then conſiſted with the weakneſs of her own, or the dignity of his Sex, that ſhe made them Friends, and obtained an Indempnity for all the Faults committed during <hi>Longchamp</hi>'s Reign (who indeed was more a King then his Maſter) ſo that his Indignation being wholly diverted upon the <hi>French</hi> King, he began a new War that was like to prove more chargeable then the old, which he had ſo lately ended. To maintain which he had new Projections for raiſing Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; but Providence having determin'd to put an end to his Ambition and Avarice, offer'd a fatal Occaſion by the diſcovery of ſome Treaſure-trove, out of which the Diſcoverer, the Viſcount <hi>Lymoges,</hi> voluntarily tendring him a part, tempted him to claim the whole; and ſo eager was he of the Prey, that being deny'd, he beſieg'd the Caſtle of <hi>Challons,</hi> where he conceiv'd 'twas hid, from whence by a fatal Arrow ſhot from the hand of one whoſe Father and two Brothers he had kill'd with his own hand, he was unexpectedly ſlain, leaving no Iſſue either of his Body or Mind that the World took notice off, excepting his three Daughters before mention'd, father'd on him by the Prieſt, by the diſpoſal of which, though it were but in jeſt, we may ſee what he was in earneſt: For he beſtow'd his daughter Pride on the Knights Templars; his daughter Drunkenneſs on the <hi>Ceſterci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Monks, and his Daughter Leachery he left to the Clergy in general, which quickneſs of his, as it ſavour'd of Irreligion, ſo it made good that in him, which makes all things elſe ill, the comprehenſive Vice of Ingratitude, the Clergy being the only men to whom he was indebted for his Honour, Wealth, and Liberty; but the unkindneſs he ſhew'd to them living, was ſufficiently requited to him dead by one of the ſame function, who reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Place where he receiv'd his fatal wound, ſhot an Arrow at him that pierc'd deeper then that which ſlew him.</p>

This, as it was grievous to the Subject in general, ſo more particularly to the Nobility (being moſt of them deſcended out of <hi>Normandy,</hi> and by his ill management ſhut out of their ancient Inheritances there, had no other ſatisfaction for their Loſſes but by improving what was left here) who find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves thus doubly damnified, were inraged to that degree, that uſing a Martial freedom ſutable to the neceſſity of that ſtimulation by which they were urg'd, they began to recollect all the wrongs done them by his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, Father, and Brother, and to ſhew they were in earneſt, inſiſted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on renewing the great Charter of their Liberties, neither were they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided of Arguments or Arms; this contumacy of theirs being coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced by the ſullen Retirement of his own Brother <hi>Jeoffry</hi> the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop, who choſe rather to caſt himſelf into voluntary Exilement, then ſubmit any longer to his Tyranny: In vain now demands he Pledges of their Faith, whilſt they believed him himſelf to have none. Sending to the Lord <hi>Bruce</hi> for his Son to be deliver'd as an Hoſtage to him, he receiv'd an anſwer from the Mother, which it ſeems expreſt the affections, if not the ſenſe of the Father, That they would not commit their Son to his keeping, who was ſo ill a keeper of his own Brothers Son; which raſh return coſt
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:51478:120"/> him afterward his Eſtate, her her life, with the loſs of two for the ſaving one only Child; a Revenge ſo fully executed, that it could meet with no coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbuff but what muſt come from Heaven.</p>
               <p>Here began the breach that disjoynted the whole frame of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the King reſolving to keep what by advantage of time and ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>fferance he had got; the Barons continuing as obſtinately bent to recover what their Predeceſſors had ſo tamely loſt. Both ſides prepare for War; and whilſt they face and parle like men loath to ingage, yet ſcorning to quit their Cauſe, either alike confident to hope the beſt, and not unlike active to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the worſt, a new accident parted them by preſenting a new Enemy, which made the War give place as it were to a ſingle Combat. The Pope not allowing the King the Priviledge of Nominating a Succeſſor to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> he makes a Truce (I cannot call it a Peace) with his Domeſtick Adverſaries, to try his Fortune with his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Foe. The Conteſt was not like that of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> who ſhould be born firſt, but like that of <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> who ſhould be upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt. Now as deſire of Rule brought theſe two great Champions into the Liſt, ſo the confidence each other had in his ſtrength and skill to handle his Weapon, made them unreconcileable: The Pope made the firſt Paſs, who threatning to interdict the Kingdom, was anſwer'd with a Menace of confiſcating all the Lands of the Clergy, and baniſhing their Perſons: The ſecond Thruſt given by his Holineſs was a Threat of Excommunication of the Kings Perſon: To this he returned that he would utterly diſavow his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. Thus far they were upon the even Terms, and as it were hit for hit: upon the next Paſs they cloſed, and as men deſperately bent, either maked good his Charge. The Pope ſhuts up the Church doors; the King thoſe of the Cloyſters: the firſt took away all the Sacraments, leaving the dead to bury the dead, without Prieſt, Prayer, or Proceſſion: The laſt ſeized on all the Eccleſiaſtical Revenues, and diſpoſed them into Lay-hands. Whilſt they were thus in cloſe grapple, the King of <hi>France</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared as ſecond to the Triple Crown: Had the Barons then ſtept in as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond to their King, they had not only made good their own Honour, as well as his, but probably had ſecur'd the Liberties they contended for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any force, there being more to be hoped for from this Kings Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity then his Juſtice; but (which was moſt degenerous, and leaves a ſtain upon their memory never to be waſhed off) they finding him thus over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid, turn'd all their points upon his back, poyſon'd with the venome of the moſt opprobrious Calumnies that ever Majeſty ſuffer'd under, the Infamy of being not only a Tyrant, but an Infidel, all which he was fain to bear with more Conſtancy of Mind then Fortune: But as we ſee a wild Boar, when beaten out of breath, chuſes rather to dye upon the Spears of the Hunters, then to be wearied by the Dogs; ſo his Rancor turning into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, he yielded to his Nobler Enemies, and choſe rather then not have his Revenge upon them, whom he thought God and Nature had put under his diſpoſe, to humble himſelf to the Church, hoping, as 'tis thought, by their Keys to unlock the Rebels Power; but over-acting his Revenge, he ſtoop'd ſo low that the Crown fell from his Head, which the Popes Legate taking up, kept three dayes before he thought fit to reſtore it, verifying thereby the Prediction of a poor innocent Hermite, who foretold that there ſhould be no King of <hi>England;</hi> which however it was true, yet being in ſome ſenſe untrue too, 'twas in the Prerogative of him who never ſpar'd where he could ſhed Blood, to make his own Interpretation, which coſt the poor Prophet his Life.</p>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:51478:120"/>
               <p>The Barons finding him thus incens'd, and ſeeing how to make good his Revenge, he had quit his Soveraignty, they reſolv'd to quit their Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to make good their Security, intending to call in the Dolphin of <hi>France,</hi> and ſwear Fealty to him, whilſt the Common People were left to their Election, whether to take the wrong King that promis'd to do them Right, or the right King that perſiſted to do them ſo much wrong; who as little underſtanding the Principles of Religion as the dictates of Reaſon, the Bonds of Command and Obedience that ſhould hold them together ſeem'd ſo wholly ſlackned, that there was upon the Matter no other Tye on them then that of their Intereſt, which ſway'd them variouſly, according to the divers Meaſures they took of it. But as there are many Ligaments in a State that bind it ſo faſt together, that 'tis a hard thing to diſſolve them altogether, unleſs by an univerſal concurrence of Cauſes, that produce a general alteration thereof (it being ſeldom ſeen of what temper ſoever Kings are, but that they find under the greateſt deſertion imaginable a very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Party to ſtand by them upon the accompt of Affection or Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Honour or Conſcience) ſo this King (the firſt of <hi>England</hi> we find put to this ſtreight) had yet many Members of Note and Power beſides his chief Officers (whom their places confirm'd) that ſtuck cloſe to him, and ſerv'd him to the laſt; by whoſe Aſſiſtance he not only recover'd <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> reduced <hi>Wales,</hi> and kept thoſe of <hi>Scotland</hi> to their good behaviour, but notwithſtanding all the Troubles he had at home, forc'd the Chief men of either Place to give him (as the manner was in thoſe dayes) their Children to be pledges of their future Subjection: by which may be gueſt how far he had gone in the Recovery of his Tranſmarime Dominions, had not the croſs-grain'd Barons ſtood it out as they did, who refuſing to aid or attend him, until he was abſolv'd by the Pope, and after he was abſolv'd, ſtopt until he had ratified their Priviledges, and after they had the Grant of their Priviledges, declined him yet, until they had back the Caſtles he had taken from them; reſolv'd it ſeems to have both Livery and Seiſin of their ancient Rights: but whilſt they thus over-bent the Bow, they made it weak and unſerviceable: the viſible force us'd upon him in bringing him to that Conceſſion, unlooſing the Deed, and taking ſo much from the validity of ſo ſolemn an Act by the bare illegality of their Coertion, that his new Friend the Pope (to whom themſelves for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him to reconcile himſelf) thought it but a reaſonable recompence of his Humility towards him, to diſcharge him from all his Condiſcentions towards them, diſpenſing with his Oath by which all the Agreement was bound, and by definitive Sentence declaring the whole Compact null, which was confirm'd by the Excommunication of the Barons till they ſubmitted to the Sentence.</p>
               <p>Here the Scene chang'd again: and now the Pope being ingag'd on the Kings ſide, the <hi>French</hi> King on the Rebels, behold the whole Kingdom in Arms; but becauſe there were ſo few to be truſted at home, the King ſends for Forces abroad, whereof he had ſo great Supplies, that had there not been (which is almoſt incredible to relate) no leſs then forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men, Women, and Children drown'd, coming over Sea out of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> he had even eat his way out to a Conqueſt of his own People as uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, but more miſerable then that of the <hi>Norman;</hi> for with thoſe he had left he marched over moſt of the Kingdom in leſs then half a years ſpace, reduced all the Barons Caſtles to the very Borders of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and made himſelf once more abſolute Maſter of all the Cities of note, <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> only excepted, which in regard of their united Power, being ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:51478:121"/> as they were, he thought not ſafe to attack. This Extremity of the Barons drew over the <hi>French</hi> King in perſon to their relief, who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king incredible ſpeed to land at <hi>Sandwich,</hi> as quickly became Maſter of all <hi>Kent, Dover</hi> only excepted (which never would yield) through which marching up to <hi>London,</hi> he was there received with ſuch univerſal joy, that ſeveral great Lords quitting King <hi>John,</hi> came to render themſelves to him: In the mean time the Pope purſued him with an Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to pleaſe King <hi>John,</hi> who all this while acted the part of a General ſo well beyond that of a King, that many who never obeyed him in Peace, were content to follow him through the War.</p>
               <p>It was near a year that this unhappy Kingdom continued thus the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of Rapine and Cruelty, enduring the oppreſſion and horrour of two great Armies, headed by two great Kings; each chaſing the other with alternate Succeſſes through the moſt fertile parts of the Iſle, till it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Providence in Mercy to the innocent People, to take off this Indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitable Prince, whoſe heart (long flaw'd with continual Croſſes) broke at laſt by the ſlight ſtroke of a ſmall loſs, the miſcarriage of ſome few of his Carriages, which in paſſing the <hi>Waſhes</hi> betwixt <hi>Lynn</hi> and <hi>Boſton,</hi> were it ſeems overtaken by the Tyde: a misfortune, which though of no great Conſideration, yet falling out in ſuch a juncture of time, when the Indiſpoſition of his Body added not a little to that of his Mind, carried him out of the World with no leſs Violence then he forced into it; who, however born to make himſelf Enemies, had yet perhaps been happy enough, had not himſelf been the very greateſt Enemy himſelf had.</p>

               <p>Upon his Death, the King was crown'd (as his unfortunate Father and Uncle before him) the ſecond time, being willing the World ſhould know he was now arriv'd at a degree of underſtanding to rule by himſelf: which occaſion the jealous Barons took hold of, to preſs again for the Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Liberties, the Denyal whereof had coſt his Father ſo dear. This put him to a pauſe, and that diſcover'd his inclination, though not his intent; for by not denying, he hop'd to be thought willing to grant, and yet not granting, he had the vanity to be thought not to yield. But this cunctati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his, which ſhew'd him to be his Fathers own Son, plunged him into ſuch a Gulf of miſtruſt before he was aware of it, that it was nothing leſs then a Miracle he had not periſh'd in it: for as he could never get clear out of it all his Reign (the longeſt that ever any King of <hi>England</hi> had) ſo he was neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, as all ſhifting men are that entertain little deſignes they are aſham'd or afraid to own, to make uſe from that time, of ſuch Miniſters onely, as in ſerving him, would be ſure to ſerve their own turns upon him: which redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him to that indigence, that had he not found out a way to prey upon

               <p>The firſt great action he was ingaged in was the recovery of the Ground his Father loſt in France, into which he was drawn not ſo much out of affectation of Glory, as by the Solicitation of his Father in Law <hi>Hugh</hi> Earl of <hi>March;</hi> who having a quarrel with the Queen Dowager of <hi>France,</hi> upon the accompt of ſome diſpute that had paſſ'd between her and his Wife, the Queen Dowager of <hi>England,</hi> call'd in the King her Son to take advantage of the preſent diſcontent; Divers of the great men of <hi>Poictou, Britain,</hi> and <hi>Normandy,</hi> being offended that the Regency of the young King ſhould be committed to a Woman, and a <hi>Spaniard:</hi> But this deſign ending with like precipitation, as it was begun, after the Expence of ſome Blood and more Treaſure (neither of which he could well ſpare) he return'd home, attended with a petty Army of thoſe <hi>Poictovins</hi> and <hi>Britains;</hi> who by taking his part, had forfeited their own Eſtates at home. Theſe therefore he conceiv'd himſelf obliged in point of honour to provide for, and which way to do it, but by diſplacing ſuch of his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Officers, who were in places of greateſt benefit he knew not. Theſe were his <hi>Cheif-Juſticiary,</hi> his <hi>High Treaſurer,</hi> and the <hi>Marſhal</hi> of his Houſhold; upon whom therefore he permitted the envious Rabble to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge a volly of accuſations, to the end that driving them out with ſhame and loſs, he might fill up their places with thoſe ſtrangers. Theſe great Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars (for they were men whoſe wiſdom he had more need of, then they of his favour) being thus thrown down, and broken to peices by their fall, ſo ſhook the whole frame of his Throne, that every body expected when he would have fallen himſelf too, divers of the Nobility that were neareſt to him, removing themſelves for fear of the worſt. Amongſt the reſt was that famous <hi>Richard,</hi> who after the death of his brother <hi>William,</hi> was Earl Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal: a man queſtionleſs of great honour and Probity, who finding his vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences to increaſe, being heightned by the ill advice of the two <hi>Peters, De Rupibus,</hi> and <hi>De Rivallis,</hi> the one a <hi>Britain</hi> t'other a <hi>Poictovin,</hi> now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the two great Miniſters of State, combined with the reſt of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Nobility to fetch him off from theſe Rocks; firſt intreating and after threatning him, that unleſs he would put theſe and all other ſtrangers from him, they would remove both him and them, and chuſe another King. Upon this bold menace, the plaineſt and boldeſt that Subjects could give a Prince, <hi>De Rupibus</hi> adviſed him to require pledges for their Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; which they refuſing to give, without any Proceſs of Law, he cauſes them to be Proclaym'd Out-laws, and Seizes on all their Lands, with the profits whereof he rewards the <hi>Poictovins.</hi> This brought both Parties to Arm again, with like animoſity, but more Cruelty, then in his Fathers time. So that for two years together, there was no ceſſation
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:51478:122"/> from all the violences, and depredations that uſually attend a civil War, till the Biſhops finding by the much blood had been ſhed, that the heat on either ſide was much abated, interpoſ'd with the King to do the Barons reaſon, and forc'd him to yeild, though he could not conſent, to a reſtoration of their Lands and Liberties, and to the baniſhment of all ſtrangers. This however proved to be but a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary ſhift, which the preſent neceſſity of his affaires drove him to: for not long after the two great Incendiaries were admitted again to Grace; and ſo near came he to the example of his Father, as to endeavour a revocation of his Grants by the Popes Authority, being done, as he alleadged, beyond his Power, and without conſent of the Church; by which harſh Intention (though it took not effect) it is ſcarce imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble how much he added to the conceiv'd diſpleaſure of the People, to whom however he had no regard, till he had waſted himſelf ſo far by his profuſion and ſupine Stupidity, that he was reduc'd through extremity of want, to truckle under his Parliaments: who knowing their own Power, and his dependence on them for money (for as a modern<note n="*" place="margin">

After this he preyd upon the <hi>Jews</hi> (the People that always felt the weight of his neceſſities.) Neither were his Chriſtian Subjects ſo free, but that he found means to ſqueeze them by Loans, Benevolences, and New-years gifts: all which not ſufficing, he fell at laſt to down-right Beggery, and ſent to the Clergy men for ſeveral Summes to be given him as Alms. And being reduc'd to this incredible lowneſs, when he found he could not prevail upon their Charity, he try'd how far he could work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their piety, by pretending to undertake the Croſs: but that Project failing him too, the laſt and moſt fatal ſhift he had, was to reſign to the King of <hi>France</hi> whatever right he had in the Dutchy of <hi>Normandy,</hi> the Earldoms of <hi>Anjou, Poictou, Tourene,</hi> and <hi>Main,</hi> and all for no more then three hundred Crowns, and that of <hi>Anjovin</hi> money too: a pitiful Summ to redeem a half loſt Crown. The Prince likewiſe, unfortunately participating in the wants of his Father, was driven to Mortgage ſeveral pieces of his Lands too, to ſupply his Particular Neceſſities.</p>
               <p>And now all things being gone that were valuable or vendible, the Barons finding him naked and diſarm'd thought not fit to delay the matter longer; but being call'd to that fatal Parliament at <hi>Oxford,</hi> in a hot ſeaſon of the year, when all their bloods were boyling, and out of temper, without more debate they firſt ſecur'd <hi>London,</hi> the onely Magazine to begin a Rebellion, by ſhutting up the Gates, and after ſecur'd the Kingdom, by ſhutting up the Ports, to prevent the inlet of Strangers; appointing twenty four <hi>Conſervators</hi> (as they call'd them) to manage the Government, whereof twelve were to be nam'd by the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:51478:123"/> King, twelve by themſelves. But he thinking it too great a Diminution of his Majeſty, to conſent to any nomination of his own, left their twelve, call'd the <hi>Douze Peers,</hi> to take the Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Out of theſe (as it happens upon all Changes, where the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are to be amus'd with Novelty) there was choſen afterwards a <hi>Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virate,</hi> to be Super-intendent over the Twelve. Theſe were the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Spencer,</hi> to whom the three great Miniſters of State, the Chancellor, the High-Treaſurer, and the Chief Juſticiar were appointed humble aſſiſtants. And becauſe 'twas believ'd that the Liberty of the People depended on the maintenance of their Authority, the King himſelf was compell'd by Oath (as he was a Man, a Chriſtian, a Knight, a King Crown'd and anointed) to uphold them, and acquit them of their Legal Obedience, whenſoever he went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to infringe the great Charter by which they held this Prerogative.</p>
               <p>Here they had him bound up hand and foot, with that Curſe upon him which his Father of all others moſt dreaded, and with which his Flatterers moſt terrified him whenever the Diſpute of Liberty came in queſtion, of being a King without a Kingdom, a Lord without a Dominion, a Subject to his Subjects (for they had invaded his Majeſty, uſurp'd his Authority, and made themſelves ſo far Maſters of his Perſon, that they might ſeize it, whenever they pleas'd to declare for a Common-wealth.) And now to make the Affront more notable, as if they had forgotten what was the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Grievance, on which their Uſurpation was grounded (the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of Strangers) they take a Stranger to head them, making <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> (who was a French man by Birth and Deſcent) their Chief, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving deſigns of his own different from theirs (as the Earl of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> his Compeer found when 'twas too late) indeavour'd ſo to widen all Differences betwixt King and People, that if poſſible there might never be a right Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding betwixt them.</p>
               <p>The King therefore well knowing his Malice, and not being ignorant of his Ambition, fell firſt upon him, cauſing the Lord <hi>Mortimer</hi> to break in amongſt his Tenants, who quickly righted himſelf upon thoſe of <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer</hi>'s, with whom the Prince thereupon took part, as <hi>Llewellin</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> with t'other. The Prince takes <hi>Brecknock-Caſtle; Monford</hi> that of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> and after that, thoſe of <hi>Worceſter</hi> and <hi>Shrewsbury;</hi> from whence he marched directly to the Iſle of <hi>Ely</hi> without Reſiſtance. The King fearing his approach to <hi>London</hi> (like thoſe, who to ſave their Lives in a Storm, are content to ſling their Goods overboard) demanded a Peace, and willingly yielded up all his Caſtles into the hands of the Barons, to the intent they might be as a publick Security for the inviolable Obſervation of the Proviſions of <hi>Oxford,</hi> conceding to the baniſhment of all the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that were left: This Condeſcention of his however occaſion'd rather a Truce then a Peace, of which he had this benefit, to gain time till he could be better provided. A Parliament being hereupon call'd at <hi>London,</hi> the freedom of Debate there renew'd the Quarrel, and each ſide confident of the Juſtice of their Arms, at <hi>Northampton</hi> they came to Battel, which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was well fought, yet the worſt Cauſe had the worſt Succeſs. The Barons were beaten, and amongſt other Priſoners of note that were then taken was the young <hi>Monford,</hi> the Heir and Hope of his Father <hi>Leiceſter;</hi> and Fortune thus uniting with Authority, made the Barons ſtoop, though
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:51478:123"/> they could not ſubmit, to beg the Peace they had before refus'd, wherein being rejected with ſcorn, they became deſperate, who were before but doubtful: which <hi>Leiceſter</hi> perceiving, and being a man skilful in ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, took that opportunity to bring them to a ſecond Battel, in which he ſupply'd his want of Hands with a Stratagem that ſhew'd he had no want of Wit, placing certain Enſigns without Men on the ſide of a Hill, not far from the place where he gave the onſet; whereby he ſo fortunately amuz'd the Enemy, that he eaſily obtain'd a Victory, and ſuch an one as ſeem'd to turn the Scale beyond all poſſibility of Recovery: For in it were taken the King himſelf, his Brother the late King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> the Prince, and moſt of the principal Lords, and by killing Five thouſand of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People on the place, he ſo terrified all the reſt of the Royal Party, that for a year and an half afterwards no body durſt look him in the Face: all which time he ſpent in reducing the Kingdom under his own diſpoſe, putting in and out whom he pleas'd, and filling up all places Military and Civil with Creatures of his own, carrying the King about with him (as a skilful Rebel) to countenance the Surrender of Towns and Caſtles to him; continuing thus the inſolence of his Triumph, till it ſwell'd to that diſproportionate Greatneſs, that his Confederate <hi>Glouceſter</hi> began to be jealous, if not afraid of it; and out of that Diſtruſt quarrel'd with him, upon pretence of not having made equal diſtribution of the Spoil nor Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, charging him to have releas'd whom he pleas'd, and at what rate, without the conſent of the reſt of the Confederacy; urging further, that he did not ſuffer a Parliament to be conven'd, as was agreed betwixt them, to the end himſelf might be Arbitrary: Laſtly, objected that his Sons were grown Inſolent by his Example, and had affronted ſeveral of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering Barons, who would have ſatisfaction of him.</p>
               <p>During this Diſpute, the Prince (by connivance of ſome of the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented Faction) broke Priſon, to whom <hi>Glouceſter</hi> joyn'd himſelf; and rallying together the ſcatter'd Parties that had long attended the advantage of ſuch a turn, they made themſelves ſo conſiderable, that in ſhort time they were able to bring the buſineſs to a poiſe. <hi>Leiceſter</hi> put it to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of another Battel, but not without apparent diſpondency, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by what he ſaid, when they were going to give the firſt Charge, for he told thoſe Lords that were neareſt him, <hi>That they would do well to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their Souls to God, for that their Bodies were the Enemies.</hi> However he omitted nothing that might ſpeak him (as he was) a brave and valiant General, till his Son firſt, and after himſelf were ſlain; at the inſtant of whoſe fall there happen'd ſuch a Clap of Thunder, as if Heaven it ſelf had fought againſt him, and that none could have given him his death, but that power to which he owed his life. And ſo the King was rid of him, whom he once declar'd to have been more affraid of then of Lightning and Thunder: a Perſon too great for a Subject, and ſomething too little to be a King. But had he (as he was deſcended from the ſtock of<note n="*" place="margin">His Father was <hi>Simon,</hi> youngeſt Son of <hi>Simon</hi> Earl of <hi>Fureux,</hi> deſcended from <hi>Almerick</hi> baſe Son of <hi>Robert</hi> (ſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam'd the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>) King of <hi>France.</hi>

               <p>This happy Victory gave the King ſome eaſe, but 'twas not in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of any Force to give him perfect reſt, whilſt the diſtemperature of the Time was ſuch, that the Wound which ſeem'd perfectly heal'd, broke out afreſh. <hi>Glouceſter</hi> himſelf, though he had deſerted his old Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> would not yet quit the good old Cauſe, but imbracing the very firſt Occaſion of Diſcontent he met with, retired three years after from Court, and having got new Forces, ſinds out new Evil Counſellors

Neither could the Pope<hi>'s</hi> Legate prevail with him to come in, though upon tearms ſafe and honourable, tendering the Publick Faith of the Kingdom, and which was then thought greater, that of the Church to them: So much were they tranſported with the Opinion of their Cauſe, or by the falſhood of their hopes, till this ſtubbornneſs of theirs provok'd the King to raiſe a new Army, the Command whereof was given to his Son <hi>Edward,</hi> that proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Prince, whoſe Fortune then being not able to reſiſt, he had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to conclude that War, and conſequently to put a Period to all his Fathers turmo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Wales</hi> being thus totally reduced by the irrecoverable fall of <hi>Llewellen</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> the laſt of their Princes, that were ever able to make reſiſtance, and thoſe ignorant People made thereby happier then they wiſh'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be, by being partakers of the ſame Law and Liberty with thoſe that conquer'd them: he ſetled that Title on his eldeſt Son, and ſo paſſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver into <hi>France</hi> to ſpend as many years abroad in Peace as he had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in War; in which time he renew'd his League with that Crown, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated the Differences betwixt the Crowns of <hi>Scicily</hi> and <hi>Arragon,</hi> and ſhew'd himſelf ſo excellent an Arbitrator, that when the right of the Crown of <hi>Scotland,</hi> upon his return home, came to be diſputed with Six, ſome ſay Ten Competitors, after the death of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third, the Umpirage was given to him: who ordered the matter ſo wiſely, that he kept off the final Deciſion of the main Queſtion, as many years as there were Rivals put in for it, deferring Judgment till all, but two only, were diſputed out of their Pretenſions. Theſe were <hi>Baliol</hi> and <hi>Bruce;</hi> the firſt deſcended from the elder Daughter of the right Heir, the laſt from the Son of the younger, who having as 'twas thought the weaker Title, but the moſt Friends, King <hi>Edward</hi> privately offered him the Crown, upon Condition of doing Homage and Fealty to him for it; the greatneſs of his Mind
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:51478:126"/> (which beſpoke him to be a King before he was one) ſuffer'd him not to accept the terms; whereupon King <hi>Edward</hi> makes the ſame Propoſition to <hi>Baliol,</hi> who better content it ſeems with the outſide of Majeſty, accepted the Condition. But ſee the Curſe of ill-got Glory: ſhewing himſelf ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with ſo little, he was thought unworthy of any, being ſo abhor'd of his People for it, that upon the firſt occaſion they had to quarrel with his Juſtice (as who ſhould ſay, they would wound him with his own Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon) they appeal'd to King <hi>Edward,</hi> who thereupon ſummon'd him to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in <hi>England,</hi> and was ſo rigid to him upon his appearance, he would permit none elſe to plead his Cauſe, but compell'd him in open Parliament to anſwer for himſelf as well as he could. This being an Indignity ſo much beneath the ſufferance of any private Perſon, much more a King, ſunk ſo deep into his Breaſt, that meditating nothing after but Revenge, as ſoon as he return'd home (ſecuring himſelf firſt by a League and Allyance with the King of <hi>France,</hi> to whoſe Brothers Daughter he married his Son) he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced his Allegiance, and defied King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Power, no leſs then he did his Juſtice. This begat a War betwixt the two Nations, that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued much longer then themſelves, being held up by alternate Succeſſes near three hundred years; a longer dated difference perhaps then is to be found in any other Story of the World, that Rancor which the Sword bred increaſing continually by the deſire of Revenge, till the one ſide was almoſt wholly waſted, t'other wholly wearied. <hi>Baliol,</hi> the ſame time King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> required him to do Homage for <hi>Scotland</hi> here, prevailed with the French King to require the like from him for his Territories there: this began the Quarrel, that the Diviſion, by which King <hi>Edward,</hi> which may ſeem ſtrange, parting his Greatneſs, made it appear much greater, whilſt himſelf advanc'd againſt <hi>Baliol,</hi> and ſent his Brother the Earl of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> to anſwer the King of <hi>France. Baliol</hi> finding himſelf overmatch'd, as well as over-reach'd, renew'd his Homage, in hopes to preſerve his Honour. But King <hi>Edward</hi> reſolving to bind him with ſtronger Fetters then Oaths, ſent him Priſoner into <hi>England:</hi> whereby thoſe of that Country wanting not only a Head, but a Heart, to make any further reſiſtance, he turn'd his Fury upon the King of <hi>France,</hi> haſtning over what Forces he could to continue that War, till himſelf could follow after. But Fortune being preingaged on the other ſide, diſpoſed that whole Affair to ſo many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes, that nothing anſwered Expectation; and which was worſe, the Fame of his Male-Adventures ſpirited a private perſon (worthy a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<note n="*" place="margin">Wallis.</note> Name then he had) to riſe in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who rallying together as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as durſt by ſcorning Miſery adventure upon it, defied all the Forces of <hi>England</hi> ſo fortunately, that he was once very near the redeeming his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing Country-men; and had he had leſs Vertue, might poſſibly have had more ſucceſs: For ſcorning to take the Crown when he had won it (a Modeſty not leſs fatal to the whole Nation then himſelf) by leaving room for Ambition he made way for King <hi>Edward</hi> to Re-enter the ſecond time, who by one ſingle Battel (but fought with redoubled Courage) made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf once more Lord of that miſerable Kingdom; all the principal Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers (<hi>Wallis</hi> only excepted) crowding in upon Summons, to ſwear Fealty the third time to him. This had been an eaſie Pennance, had they not; toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their Faith, reſigned up their Laws and Liberties, and that ſo ſervilely, that King <hi>Edward</hi> himſelf judging them unworthy to be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued any longer a Nation, was perſwaded to take from them all the Records and Monuments, whereby their Anceſtors had recommended any of Glory to their Imitation. Amongſt other of the <hi>Regalia</hi>'s then loſt, was that famous
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:51478:126"/> Marble Stone (now lodg'd in <hi>Weſtminſter-Abby</hi>) wherein their Kings were crown'd, in which (as the Vulgar were perſwaded) the Fate of their Country lay, for that there was an ancient Propheſie Ingraven on it, which denoted that wherever that Stone ſhou d be placed, there ſhould the Scotch Dominion take place; a Prediction veriſied in our days in the Perſon of King <hi>James</hi> the Sixth, the firſt of their Kings ever crowned here. With this he took away likewiſe all their Books and Bookmen, as if reſolved to rob them of all ſenſe of Liberty as well as of Liberty it ſelf: only the brave <hi>Wallis</hi> continued yet Lord of himſelf, and being free, kept up their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits by the Elixir of his Perſonal Courage, mixt with an Invincible Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and Patience, till being betray'd by one of his Companions (a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain ſit to be canoniz'd in Hell) he was forc'd to yield (though he would never ſubmit) firſt to the King, after to the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> which judging him to dye as a Traytor, eterniz'd the Memory of his Fidelity and Fortitude, and made him (what he could never have made himſelf) the moſt glorious Martyr that Country ever had. No ſooner was he dead but <hi>Robert Bruce,</hi> Son to that <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Carric,</hi> who was Competitor with <hi>Baliol,</hi> appeared as a new Vindictor, who eſcaping out of the Engliſh Court (where he had long liv'd unſuſpected) headed the confuſed Body, which wanted only a King to unite them in Counſel, Power, and Affection; but unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately laying the Foundation of his Security in Blood, murthering his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin <hi>Cumin,</hi> who had been one of the Competitors, upon pretence he held correſpondence with King <hi>Edward</hi> (the horror of which fact was aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the manner and place, for he took him whilſt he was at his Prayers in the Church) it coſt him no leſs blood to wipe off that ſingle ſtain then to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his Title; the Partakers with the Family of <hi>Cumin,</hi> who were many, migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and eager of Revenge, joyning thereupon with the Engliſh againſt him.</p>
               <p>This drew King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth time perſonally into <hi>Scotland,</hi> who had he ſuffered his Revenge to have given place ſo far to his Juſtice, as to have purſued <hi>Bruce</hi> as an Offender, rather then as an Enemy, he might poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly have done more in doing leſs then he did, but he not only ſacrific'd the two innocent Brothers of <hi>Bruce,</hi> making them, after they became his Priſoners, anſwer with their lives the penalty of their Brother's Guilt, but declar'd he would give no Quarter to any of his Party, whereby he not only drove them cloſer together, but arm'd them with Deſperation; which as it hath a keeper edge then hope, ſo it wounded ſo deep, and inra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them to that degree of Courage, as not only to give the greateſt Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw to the greateſt Army that ever the Engliſh brought thither, but to repay the meaſure of Blood in as full manner as it was given, or intended, and in the end broke the great Chain of his well laid Deſign, which was to have in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This violent proceeding of the Lords, as it ſhew'd a roughneſs of the Times ſuitable to that of their own Natures, ſo it was the firſt occaſion of the ſecond Civil War of <hi>England,</hi> which broke out like a Fire, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing long ſmother'd, was all in a Flame as ſoon almoſt as it was perceiv'd; and however Fate for ſome time ſeem'd to make a Pauſe, whether ſhe ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the Tragedy which ſhe could not end, turning the Storm another way, by ſeveral Invaſions from <hi>Scotland,</hi> which held long enough to have diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the virulent humour, and let out blood enough to have cool'd all their heat, allaying it ſo far, that eaſie Interceſſions prevail'd to keep them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:51478:128"/> for ſome years; yet nothing could ſo ſtop the Courſe of Nature, but that the monſtrous Iſſue, when it was come to its birth, forc'd its way: the Diſcontents that had been ſo long ripening (even from the time of this Kings Great-grand-father) breaking out like a Boyl, ſurcharg'd with Anguiſh and Corruption, which was no ſooner emptied by the death of one, but it was fill'd with Rancor and Envy, by the Entertainment of New Favourites. As <hi>Gaveſton</hi> before, ſo the two <hi>Spencers</hi> afterward, the Farher and the Son, took upon them to Monopolize his Grace, and were thereupon generally charg'd with the odious deſign of bringing in an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Government, with imbezeling the Treaſure of the Nation, and doing ſeveral ill Offices betwixt the King and Queen, maintaining their own by apparent wrong to the Eſtates of other Lords, particularly of the Earls of <hi>Hereford</hi> and <hi>Mortimer;</hi> out of whoſe hands it ſeems they had bought ſome Lands, which lying convenient to their Eſtates, was in the firſt place offered to them: Theſe, though they were ſuch Objections as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating but to particular Perſons, perhaps not without particular Reaſons, might be excus'd, if not juſtified; yet being heaped up together, made a general grievance, and the Earl of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> the Bell-weather of Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at that time, thought it worthy the Barons taking up of Arms to puniſh them. The King anſwer'd for them, and undertook they ſhould come and anſwer for themſelves; the Father, he ſaid, was imployed by him beyond the Seas, and the Son was guarding the Cinque Ports according to his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and therefore he thought it was againſt Law and Cuſtome to condemn them unheard. But nothing would ſatisfie their Accuſers without a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of Baniſhment, and though the Preſident was ſuch as might as well affect themſelves as their Poſterity, yet Hatred being no leſs blind then Love, they preſer'd their preſent Revenge before the Fears of a future in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience.</p>
               <p>All differences being thus compos'd, I cannot ſay calm'd, an acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal affront given to the Queen by one that was over-wiſe in his Office, put all again out of order beyond recovery. A <hi>Caſtelan</hi> of the Lord <hi>Badliſmers</hi> at <hi>Leeds</hi> (denying her Majeſty Lodging there as ſhe was paſſing by in her Progreſs, out of a Diſtruſt ſhe might poſſeſs her ſelf of the Caſtle, and keep it for the King) ſhe exaſperated the King to that degree, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged the place, took it, and in it the politick Governour, whom without legal Proceſs he hang'd up preſently, and ſeizing all the Goods and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his Lord, ſent his Wife and Children to the <hi>Tower.</hi> This was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for ſo great a violation of the Liberty of the Subject, that being done by the King himſelf, nothing could determine the Right, but the Sword; and accordingly they met the ſecond time in Arms, where Fortune was pleas'd to confirm the Sentence given by the King, by giving up into his hands many more conſiderable Lives, then that for which they were ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded; amongſt the reſt was that of the Earl of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> himſelf (the firſt Prince of the Blood that ever was brought to the Block here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>) and with him fourteen of the Principal Barons, none of which were ſpar'd, but forc'd to give up their Lives and Eſtates as a Reward to the Victors. And not long after the <hi>Spencers</hi> were recall'd and re-ſtated, who finding the publick Treaſure wholly exhauſted, and a chargeable War yet continued with <hi>Scotland,</hi> thought it but neceſſary to make ſuch Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as might enable his Majeſty to carry on that great Work, wherein he had been ſo unlucky, without oppreſſing the People: amongſt the reſt, they preſum'd unfortunately to abridge the Queen, leſſening hers, as they had done the Kings Houſhold-Train, by which Improvident Providence they
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:51478:128"/> ſo irritated her (being a Woman of a proud vindictive Spirit) that ſhe privately complain'd thereof to the King of <hi>France</hi> her Brother, who took that occaſion to quarrel with the King about his Homage for <hi>Gaſcoigne,</hi> and upon his Refuſal, poſſeſſed himſelf of ſeveral Pieces there: and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all that <hi>Edmond</hi> Earl of <hi>Kent</hi> could do, whom his Brother the King ſent over with ſufficient Strength, as 'twas thought, to repell him by force, continued his Depredations there; this bringing a Neceſſity that either the King muſt go over himſelf, or the Queen; the firſt to compel, or the other (being his beloved Siſter) to mediate with h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Principal in her Councel, as being ſo in her Affections, was young <hi>Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> a Servant fit for ſuch a Miſtreſs, and ſuch a Maſter, as this Queen and her Husband; who having eſcaped out of the <hi>Tower</hi> where he had been long a Priſoner (and as he thought very injuriouſly, in reſpect he render'd himſelf to Mercy before the great Battel with the Barons, and by his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion contributed much to the Kings gaining that Victory) contriv'd with her how to ſet up the Prince, and with him himſelf; and becauſe the Earl of <hi>Kent</hi> was upon the place, they made it their firſt buſineſs to work off him to the Party.</p>
               <p>Here began that fatal breach from whence the World concluded that this unhappy King having loſt one half of himſelf, could not long hold out before he loſt the whole, it not being reaſonable to expect that his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſhould be truer to him then his Wife, eſpecially ſince the right Heir took the wrong ſide. Upon the firſt apprehenſion he recall'd them home, but upon ſecond thoughts he forbids their Return: at firſt he ſeem'd impatient of their abſence, as the only Friends he could conſide in; but on a ſudden he dreads their approach as the moſt Mortal Enemies he had, forbids their landing by Proclamation, and ſets out no leſs then three Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals to prevent it: they in like manner, whilſt he preſt for their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, delay'd their Receſs; but when they found themſelves baniſh'd, grew as impatient of being kept out. The King of <hi>France</hi> not owning ſo vile a deſign, ſo as to give any ready aſſiſtance to it, they withdrew into <hi>Holland,</hi> whoſe Earl being a rich and politick Prince, upon the contracting Prince <hi>Edward</hi> to his Daughter he furniſhed them with Money and Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to tranſport them.</p>
               <p>Landing at <hi>Harwich,</hi> they were ſo welcom'd by the diſcontented Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that the poor King foreſeeing the enſuing danger, and not finding
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:51478:129"/> that Faith in the <hi>Londoners</hi> which he expected, withdrew into the Weſt, in order to paſſing over into <hi>Ireland;</hi> but meeting with a Storm at Sea that threatned as eminent danger as that by Land, he was forced to comply with the contrary Winds, and direct his Courſe towards <hi>Wales,</hi> where deſtitute of Councel as well as Courage, he lay obſcurely, till his Majeſty extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd like a Torch held downwards.</p>
               <p>His Son (though he was as yet under Wardſhip himſelf) was made Guardian of the Kingdom, a Title ſo much greater then that of King, by how much he had the Superiority over both: readily was he prevail'd with to take away the lives of the two fatal Favourites, the <hi>Spencers;</hi> ſo that 'twas thought he would not be over-modeſt in taking the Crown after: it being ſo eaſie a Temptation to conſent to depoſe him, who had already up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the matter depos'd himſelf. However, Nature prevail'd ſo much o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Ambition, contrary to all their Expectations, or Grace rather over Nature, that he refus'd to accept it, till his Father might be prevail'd with to give it him as a Bleſſing; who thereupon reſign'd it, but with ſuch a moving Meekneſs, as for the preſent time melted the very Queen her ſelf, and ſeemingly touch'd her with ſo much Regret at the Renuntiation, that the Biſhop of <hi>Hereford</hi> (the great Engineer of this proſperous Treaſon) doubting her Conſtancy in point of Malice, to be as uncertain as her Faith in point of Affection; or perhaps rather dreading the young Kings Piety, back'd with the old Kings power, haſtned his Death by all means poſſible: but finding himſelf for ſome time diſappointed by the force of Providence, or the ſtrength of his Nature, which neither ill Air, ill Diet, nor want of Reſt could impair, he put him into the hands of two Miſcreants, ſit to be imploy'd in ſo black a Purpoſe; to whom he inclos'd in a Letter one onely Line, which was ſo twiſt up, as might ſerve to ſtrangle any Prince what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, comprehending a double ſenſe to warrant them, and excuſe himſelf if need were: the words were theſe, <q>Edvardum regem occidere nolite timere bonum eſt.</q>

               <p>This being not pointed, the Devil who invented it, inſtructed them in the true meaning of the damnable Oracle, which accordingly they put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution with ſo much cruelty and horror, that never King died as this poor Planet-ſtruck Prince did, having a Pipe thruſt up into his Fundament (to the intent that the Marks of their Violence might not be perceiv'd outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) and through that, with a red hot Iron they penetrated his Bowels to his Heart: yet was not this Death poſſibly more miſerable or grievous to him then his Life, after he became forſaken of all his Subjects, Friends, and Allies in general, and particularly of his own Wife, Son, and Brother, not to ſay of himſelf too (if ſo be we do not reckon them a part of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) conſidering with what ſtrange abjection he reſign'd firſt his Crown, after his Life: For to ſay truth, never was King turn'd out of a Kingdom, or out of the World, as he was. Many Kingdoms have been loſt by the chance of War, but this Kingdom (as one obſerves) was loſt before any Dy was caſt for it: no blow ſtruck, no Battel fought, loſt before it was taken from him, whilſt by betraying himſelf firſt, he taught others to do it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: ſtrange Riddle of State, that a Crown ſhould be gain'd forcibly, yet without force; violently, yet with conſent; both Parties agreed, yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pleas'd; for he was not willing to leave his Kingdom, and he that was to have it as unwilling to take it without he gave it him; the Queen was not pleas'd he ſhould part with it without he parted with his Life too,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:51478:129"/> judging that by having a part he might recover the whole; or that her ſelf having parted with the whole, could not intitle her ſelf to any part, but by his Death, and therefore having taken the Kingdom from him openly, there was a kind of neceſſity of taking away his Life ſecretly.</p>
               <p>Poor Prince, how unkindly was he treated upon no other account but that of his own over-great kindneſs. Other Princes are blam'd for not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rul'd by their Counſellors, he for being ſo: who whilſt he liv'd they would have thought to be a Sot, but being dead, they could have found in their hearts to have made him a Saint. How far he wrong'd his People doth not appear, there being very few or no Taxations laid upon them all his time: but how rude and unjuſt they were towards him, is but too manifeſt. But their Violence was ſeverely repaid by Divine Vengeance, not only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole Kingdom, when every Vein in the Body Politick was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward opened to the endangering the letting out of the Life-blood of the Monarchy in the Age following; but upon every particular Perſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to, or concern'd in his Death. For as the Throne of his Son that was thus ſet in blood (though without his own guilt) continued to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bru'd all his Reign, which laſted above fifty years, with frequent Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Battels, or Slaughters; the Sword of Juſtice, or his own, being hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ever ſheath'd all his time: So 'tis ſaid that the Queen her ſelf dyed mad upon the apprehenſion of her own in <hi>Mortimer</hi>'s diſgrace, who was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted at <hi>Tyburn,</hi> and hung there two dayes to be a ſpectacle of Scorn. His Brother <hi>Edmond</hi> had this puniſhment of his Diſloyalty to be condemn'd to loſe his Head for his Loyalty, it being ſuggeſted (and happy it had been for him if it had been prov'd) that he indeavoured the Reſtoration of his Brother; his death being imbitter'd by the mockery of Fortune, whilſt by keeping him upon the Scaffold five hours together before any Body could be found that would execute him, he was deluded with a vain hope of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaved. The Fiend <hi>Tarlton,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Hereford,</hi> who invented the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Oracle that juſtified the murther, dy'd with the very ſame Torture as if the hot Iron that fear'd his Conſcience had been thruſt into his Bowels. Of the two Murtherers one was taken and butcher'd at Sea, t'other dyed in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile perhaps more miſerable: And for the Nobility in general that were A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors in the Tragedy, they had this Curſe upon them, that moſt of their Race were cut off by thoſe Civil Diſcords of their divided Families, to which this ſtrange violation gave the firſt beginning not long after.</p>

To the attaining the firſt, there was a fair oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity offer'd by the unreconcileable conteſt of two well-match'd Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, whoſe Right and Intereſt were ſo evenly poys'd, that the leaſt grain of his Power might turn the Scale either way: to the Recovery of the other, there was yet a fairer Opportunity given him by the Revolt of <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Artois,</hi> one of the firſt Princes of the Blood of that Kingdom, and Brother in Law to the preſent King <hi>Philip de Valois;</hi> who being incens'd by a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment given againſt him for the County of <hi>Artois,</hi> recover'd by his Aunt the Dutcheſs of <hi>Burgoigne,</hi> came over into <hi>England,</hi> with a Reſolution to ſet aſide his Title who had before ſet aſide his: Neither wanted he a Power ſuitable to his deſired Revenge; for being well acquainted with the ſecrets of that Kings Councel, all which he reveal'd to King <hi>Edward,</hi> and being able to give him good ſecurity for the affections of ſeveral of the chief Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours there that depended on him, 'tis no marvel he ſo quickly blew that ſpark of Glory which he found wrapt up in the Embers of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>'s ambitious Thoughts, into ſuch a Flame, as threatning the Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that goodly Country, made all Chriſtendom afraid of the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>

King <hi>Philip</hi> had a double advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Engliſh; firſt in the Loyalty and Affections of the French, as being their Natural Prince; ſecondly by the authority of the <hi>Salique Law,</hi> which however it was not ſo clear, but that it might admit of much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, yet being back'd with a Poſſeſſion, which made up eleven of the twelve Points controvertable (there having been a Succeſſion of three Sons of <hi>Philip le Bell</hi> (Queen <hi>Iſabels</hi> Father, by whom King <hi>Edward</hi> claim'd) each inheriting Succeſſively as the next Heir Male, notwithſtanding each of them left Daughters by which the preſent King <hi>Philip</hi> came now in as Heir Maſculine) it ſeem'd ſo like an adjudged Caſe, that King <hi>Edward</hi> thinking it better to cut the Knot, then loſe time in trying to untie it, reſolv'd to put it to the Determination of a Battel. This Reſolution of his was ſo lowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proclaim'd every where abroad, as well as at home, that like Thunder before a Storm, the very noiſe of his Preparations made all Chriſtendom ſhake, and ſo ſhake, that it fell into Parties: the Princes of each Country round about, like Herdſmen before a Tempeſt, flying ſome to one ſide, ſome to another; all ſeeking rather to ſhelter themſelves, then to add any thing to the Party they flew to.</p>

               <p>The Captivity of theſe two Kings at one time, ſhews at once the Power and Glory of this great King, who riding triumphant on the wings of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, never wanted the means to make or continue himſelf Victorious, and prevailing no leſs over his own Subjects then over his Enemies, theſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued by his Wiſdom, as thoſe by his Courage: Some have made it a doubt whether he got more by his Scepter or his Sword; the benefit of Ranſoms abroad (notwithſtanding the many Princes taken Priſoners) being much ſhort of the Aids given him at home; ſo that they that have taken the pains to ſtate his Accompts, reckon that out of that one ſingle Impoſition upon Wool (which continued Six years) he was able to diſpend a thouſand Marks a day; which I have the rather noted, to ſhew how the Kingdom flouriſh'd as well as the King, gaining (as all wiſe States do) by their layings out: for the whole Revenues of the Crown in his Grand-fathers days were eſteem'd to be not much above a hundred thouſand Marks a year.</p>

The Scotch King could not recover his Liberty in double the time, being the leſs able to redeem himſelf, for that he was upon the matter but half a King, the other half being in the poſſeſſion of <hi>Baliol,</hi> who to ſecure a Moyety to himſelf, ſurrendred the whole to King <hi>Edward,</hi> whoſe Magnificence vying with his Juſtice, he gave it back again upon Terms more befitting a Brother then a Conqueror, ſhewing therein a Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs, that no King perhaps beſides himſelf would have been guilty of, nor probably he neither, had either his People been leſs bountiful to him, or Fortune leſs conſtant, which, to ſay truth, never forſook him, till he (like his Father) forſook himſelf, leaving all Action, and bidding adieu to the World ten years before he went out of it, declining ſo faſt from the fortieth year of his Government, that it may rather be ſaid, his famous Son Prince <hi>Edward</hi> (commonly call'd the Black Prince) reign'd then he; and happy 'twas for him that when his own Underſtanding fail'd him, he had ſo good a Supporter, who having it in his power to diſpoſe of Kingdoms whilſt he
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:51478:131"/> liv'd, ought not to be denyed, after he dyed, the honour of being eſteem'd equal to Kings in the Prerogative of a diſtinct Character.</p>
               <p>Begin we then the Date of his Government from the Battel of <hi>Craſſy,</hi> which happening in the Sixteenth year of his Age, makes the Computation of his Glory to commence near about the ſame time his Fathers did (who however he was King at fourteen, rul'd not till after <hi>Mortimer</hi>'s death) by which Battel he ſo topt the Fortune of <hi>France</hi> (as his Father had that of <hi>England</hi>) that he may be ſaid to have taken thereby Livery in order to the Seiſin of that Kingdom: And after the Recovery of <hi>Calais,</hi> it may be ſaid the Keys of the Kingdom, rather then of that Town, were deliver'd into his hand; for that he therewith open'd all the Gates of almoſt every Town he came to, till the King of <hi>France</hi> incompaſſed him like a Lion in a Toil, with no leſs then 60000 of the beſt Men of <hi>France,</hi> and brought him to that ſtreight, that it ſeem'd alike diſadvantageous to ſight or yield, and (which made the danger more conſiderable as things then ſtood) <hi>England</hi> it ſelf was in ſome hazard of being loſt with him: here he ſeem'd to have been as well accomptable to his Country, as to his Father for his Courage and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion; and how well he acquitted himſelf appears by the Sequel: when forcing Hope out of Deſpair (like fire out of a Flint) he neceſſitated his Men to try for Conqueſt, by ſhewing them how impoſſible 'twas for him to yield; and by that incomparable Obſtinacy of his, made Fortune ſo ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour'd of his Courage, that ſhe follow'd him wherever he went, while his Sword made its way to Victory, and his Courteſie to the Affections of the Conquer'd, whom he treated with that regard and generoſity, that many of them were gainers by the loſs, being diſmiſs'd with honourable Preſents, that made his ſecond Conqueſt over them greater then the firſt; the King of <hi>France</hi> himſelf being ſo well pleas'd with his Bondage, that he return'd vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily into <hi>England</hi> after he was redeem'd, to meet two Kings more that might be Witneſs of his Reſpect and Gratitude: In ſhort, he was as King of <hi>England</hi> on the other ſide the Water, as his Father was on this ſide, keeping ſo ſplendid a Court in <hi>Acquitaine,</hi> that no leſs then three Kings came to viſit him too all at once; theſe were the King of <hi>Majorque, Navar,</hi> and <hi>Caſtile:</hi> the laſt of which craving Aid of him againſt an Uſurper, who was back'd by an Army conſiſting of no leſs then One hundred thouſand men (if the Writers of thoſe times ſay true) was re-inſtated accordingly by his ſingle power, to ſhew the World that he could as well make Kings as unmake them. His ſecond Brother, who had the Title of King by marrying with the King of <hi>Caſtile</hi>'s Daughter and Heir, being principally indebted to him for the honour of that Title, and it prov'd a fatal Debt both to him and his Son <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, coſting the one his Life, the other both Life and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom too: for as himſelf never recover'd the health he loſt in undertaking that Expedition, ſo his Son never recover'd the diſadvantage put upon him afterward by his Uncle <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> who by that means having got the Regency of his drooping Father King <hi>Edward,</hi> who tyred with Action ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then Age, fatally ſubmitted to the loſs of more years of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then he got by his unnatural Anticipation from his own Father, and ſuffer'd himſelf to be buried alive (as we may ſay) under his Cradle, put fair for ſetting his Nephew aſide, but wanting a Colour for ſo apparent an Injuſtice (his jealous Father the Black Prince, having declar'd him his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor in his life time, to prevent all tricks) he thought it enough to make way for his Son to do it, and accordingly put ſuch an impreſſion of diſlike upon the innocent Youth at his very firſt Edition, as prov'd Indelible in his riper years: for the very ſame day he was preſented to take his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:51478:132"/> Seat in Parliament, as Heir apparent to the Crown (being then but eleven years old) he taught him to demand a Subſidy, purpoſely to turn the Peoples blood, who were then big with their Complaint of Taxes. But poſſibly he is made more ſplenetick, as well as more politick, then he was; for it was ſcarce poſſible to make the Youth more odious then he had made himſelf before, by diſguſting thoſe two potent Factions of the Church and the City of <hi>London,</hi> who, to ſhew how weary they were of his governing the old Child his Father, would not after his Death let him longer Rule the young Child his Nephew, but purpoſely depos'd him, to the end (as they ſaid) that he might not depoſe the other.</p>
               <p>Thus this great King ended as ingloriouſly as he began, who having ſtept into the Throne a little before he ſhould, 'tis the leſs wonder he left it a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before it was expected he would: eſpecially if we conſider, that in out-living the beſt Wife, and the beſt Son in the World, he had a little out-liv'd himſelf; being ſo unfortunate, notwithſtanding his great good Fortunes, as to ſee his Glory unravel'd, as well as his Happineſs, in great part: there being nothing left him of all his great Gettings abroad, purchaſed with ſo much Travel, Expence, and Bloodſhed, but only the poor Town of <hi>Calais,</hi> which ſignified no more then a Gate of a City left open, when all the reſt is poſſeſt by too potent an Enemy. But we muſt look on't as a Curſe that he inherited with his Crown, not to be permitted to dye till he ſaw himſelf (as his Father was) forſaken of every Body, but a poor Prieſt, that only tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to torment him with the remembrance of his Sins, and left him at laſt as he left the World, in ſuch a ſtate of uncertainty, that our Hiſtorians are yet to ſeek whether to place him amongſt the rank of our fortunate or unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Princes; the fatal diviſions of his Poſterity (which took their firſt riſe from his weakneſs) being ſo pernicious to the whole Kingdom, as well as to themſelves, that if the Dead know any thing of what is done amongſt the Living, he needed no other Hell to torture his guilty Spirit then the viſion of thoſe murthered Princes of his own Blood, whoſe Ghoſts juſt led one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther where ere they met.</p>

               <p>Now as it is eaſie to kindle a great Fire with very little blowing, when the matter is fitly diſpos'd to burn, ſo it happen'd very unluckily, that from the caſual Rudeneſs of an inconſiderable Tax-gatherer, that came into the Houſe of a poor Tiler of <hi>Deptford,</hi> and would have turn'd up the Coats of his young Daughter, to ſee whether ſhe were of Age to pay her Poll-mony, there was occaſion'd ſo over-grown a Riot, as bearing down all reſpect of Laws, Order, or Government, was not to be appeas'd with the Blood of three of the principal'ſt Miniſters of State, that is to ſay, the Chancellor (although he were Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>) the Treaſurer, and the Lord Chief Juſtice, and came at laſt ſo near to Majeſty it ſelf (for ſome of the Rebels were little leſs rude with the Kings own Mother, then his Officer had been with their Captains Daughter) that 'twas thought nothing could deliver the King himſelf from the approaching Danger, but meeting it half way: which he did with ſo well temper'd a Courage, as never King before him ſhew'd, except <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and he but once; or his own Father at the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel of <hi>Poctiers,</hi> when begirt with as many perhaps, but not ſo inſolent nor unworthy Foes. This being as much beyond the expectation of his Years, as of his Enemies, charmed them into a Submiſſion for a while; but the Diſtemper being univerſal and raging, and the Contagion ſpread inſenſibly through ſo many parts of the Kingdom, it was not poſſible to heal the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil with a Touch only. However, one would have thought ſo hopeful a Prince as this was, the Son of ſo brave a Father, and fortified with ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable a Title, could not likely have miſcarried, but muſt have ſtood firm as a Mountain, whoſe top was above all Storms; but the ſame Stars ruling at his Birth that govern'd his Great-grand-fathers Nativity, 'tis no marvail, being of the ſame temper, he ſhould fall under the ſame fate, to be kept by Flatterers from the knowledge of himſelf, till being not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he too late ſaw his Error in the experience of their Falſhood.</p>
               <p>The firſt ten years of his Government (which were the better, though not the longer part of it) he reign'd with great ſplendor, if ſo be we may properly ſay he reign'd whiles he was under the diſpoſe of others, taking all occaſions to let thoſe that attempted to diſturb him both at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, eſpecially his right and left-hand Enemies, the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> feel the ſharpneſs of his Sword, and the weight of his Power, forcing the firſt to quit their chief Deſign, having prepar'd a Navy of 1287 Ships to invade him; the other to quit their chief City, which he thereupon redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into Aſhes, to make a Bonefire that might give the whole Kingdom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice

A raſh and unadviſed Reply: which however it ſeem'd to be the Reſult of a proud and vindictive Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, was in truth ſo abject and low, ſo unlike himſelf, and ſo like his little Great-Grandſire <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, that they taking Example from the Nobility of that time, as he from that King, immediately put the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into the hands of thirteen Lords, of whom his turbulent Uncle <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter</hi> was the Chief, who having <hi>Diviſum Imperium,</hi> lookt like a great Wen upon the Face of the State, that drew all the ill humours of the Body Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick to it. The Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that was the principal Councellor of his party, and his Uncle by Marriage, was ſo amaz'd at the ſudden birth of this Oligarchy, that not daring to give any Opinion of his own in the Caſe (although he were a man of ſufficient Courage and Authority) he put him upon adviſing with all the Judges, poſſibly that what himſelf ſhould think fit, might paſs for Law out of their mouths: and accordingly Queſtions were fram'd to be propos'd to them, by which it was eaſier underſtood what the King would have to be Law, then what in truth was ſo. To all which having receiv'd poſitive Reſolves on the Kings ſide, the next Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation was how to frame ſuch a Houſe of Commons as might be brought to take part with the King againſt the Lords: and forthwith Letters were directed to all the Sheriffs and Juſtices of Peace in every County, to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their Credit and Authority, for the chuſing of ſuch Perſons, Knights and Burgeſſes for the next Seſſions, as the King and his Councel had nam'd in a Liſt ſent to them.</p>
               <p>This look'd like ſo dangerous an Induſtry, that the Regency took the Alarm at it, and truſting to no other remedy, flew to Arms. The King there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon demanded Aid of the City of <hi>London;</hi> but they failing his Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Lords grew ſo bold as to ſend to him to deliver up his ill Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, whom they call'd Traytors and Seducers. Upon this there were very great and grave Deliberations, each man being to adviſe at the price of his own Head: the Arch biſhop of <hi>York,</hi> like a man of great Faith, was of Opinion to ſight them with ſuch preſent Strength as the King had, truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Juſtice of the Cauſe: the Dukes of <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Suffolk,</hi> men of Action, but wanting the means, were for delivering up <hi>Calais</hi> to the French King, to purchaſe his Aſſiſtance. But the Majority of Voices coming from ſuch men, whoſe Fears made them rather wiſe then honeſt, were for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſing the Enemy with fair promiſes, till there were a fit opportunity to ſuppreſs them: the firſt Propoſal was thought very hazardous; the ſecond much more: beſides, there was ſuch a bitterneſs in the Pill, that no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration could make the King to ſwallow it, who not knowing what effect it might have when it was done, utterly rejected it: upon which they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly withdrew that gave the Counſel, and left him to himſelf. Whereupon the Lords Regent found an opportunity to be admitted to a Parley with him; who producing to him Letters from the King of <hi>France,</hi> which they
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:51478:134"/> had intercepted, purſuant to the Deſign of bringing in a Forreign Enemy, they mov'd him no leſs by ſhame then dread of the Conſequence, to conſent to the calling another Parliament.</p>
               <p>Upon the day of the Convention, the King came not to the Houſe, being infinitely troubled in his mind at News he had juſt then received of the Earl of <hi>Derby</hi>'s Intercepting the Duke of <hi>Ireland</hi> (who being gone as far as <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> in order to his paſſing into that Kingdom, was ſet upon by the ſaid Earl, and totally defeated, who hardly eſcaping fled into the Low-countries, where not long after he dyed.) The Lords heightened with this Succeſs, ſent a very harſh Meſſage to him, letting him know that they attended him there, and if he would not come to the Houſe according to promiſe, they would chuſe another King that ſhould hearken to their faithful advice. This though it were in effect no other, but to tell him they would depoſe him without his conſent, if he would not come and conſent to be depos'd; yet having no Retreat from it, but down a ſteep Precipice, he choſe rather to comp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Upon his firſt appearance they preſented him with a black Roll of thoſe whom he call'd his Friends, they his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, ſome to be preſcrib'd, ſome to be impriſon'd, and others baniſh'd; and in this laſt Liſt there were not only Lords but Ladies found Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents: Some were accus'd of imbeziling his Treaſure; others of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyning his Affection; all for robbing him of his Honour: whereupon ſome were to be try'd for their Lives, others for their Fortunes, and all for their Liberties: but in reſpect of their other great Affairs which were in order to what followed, they referred it to the ſucceeding Parliament, not unfitly call'd the <hi>Parliament that wrought wonders;</hi> which contrary to all other Parliaments that uſed to ſwear Obedience to the King, requir'd an Oath of him himſelf, to obſerve ſuch Rules and Orders as they ſhould preſcribe to him.</p>
               <p>Here now we have this unfortunate Prince brought to the laſt year of his Rule, though not of his Reign, beginning then to enter into his Wardſhip (as he call'd it) when he thought he was juſt got out of it. All power was put into the hands of the Dukes of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> and <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> who managed all Treaties abroad, concluded War and Peace as they thought fit, and were indeed abſolute in every point, but the Command of their own Paſſions, and uncontroulable by any but themſelves. The Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> having now digeſted the Kingdom in his thoughts, procures the Dutchy of <hi>Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine</hi> to be ſetled on him, as an earneſt of what was to follow, being the Inheritance of the Crown, and deſcended on the King from Prince <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> his Father: and having married up the King to a Child of eight years old, by whom 'twas impoſſible he could have Iſſue, with a Portion that ſcarce defraid the Charge of the Solemnity, he ſecur'd his own Pretenſions, by Legitimating three of his Baſtard Sons, in caſe his lawful Iſſue ſhould fail. The Duke of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> had the ſame Ambition in his heart, as well as the ſame Blood in his Veins, but Nature having put a diſadvantage upon him by placing him ſo far behind (being the ſixth Son of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third) he was forc'd to gratifie his Envy, inſtead of his Ambition, and reſt content with the hopes of doing his Brother a Miſchief when time ſerv'd, without any great probability of doing himſelf good. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he made a Faction, who conſpir'd with him to ſeize the King, his two Brothers <hi>Lancaſter</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> and to put them all up in Priſon, and after to execute divers Lords whom he thought to be more his Enemies, then their Friends; but the end of his Treaſon being to be himſelf betray'd by thoſe
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:51478:134"/> he made uſe of. <hi>Lancaſter</hi> came thereby to ſtand ſingle, like a great Tree, which being at its full height, ſpread his Limbs the wider, and grew to be ſo conſpicuous, that the ſucceeding Parliament deſired to ſhelter themſelves under the ſhadow of his power: hereupon he reduced the number of the thirteen Regents to ſeven only, which being all his Confidents, he with them concluded aforehand all Affairs of moment, and directed how they ſhould paſs in Parliament: An Example not leſs miſchievous to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom then the King: ſo that now there wanted no more to make him the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign but the putting on the Crown.</p>
               <p>But ſee the uncertainty of humane Glory: Having juſt finiſhed the great work of his Uſurpation, an unexpected blow from that inviſible hand that turns about the great Wheel of Cauſes, broke the frame of his projection in pieces. His Son <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Hereford</hi> accuſed by the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> of Treaſon, was forc'd to purge himſelf by the Tryal of Combat: a Law that might condemn, but never acquit him, ſince it was only poſſible to diſcharge himſelf of the danger, but never of the ſuſpition of the Crime. This being urg'd ſo far, that they were both brought into the Liſt, there was no way left to avoid the uncertainty of the Fight, but baniſhment of both; wherein though the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> got the favour to make the Exile of his Son but temporary, when the others was perpetual, yet the affront that Fortune ſeem'd to give him by this accidental Diſgrace, came ſo near his heart, that his Son had no ſooner taken leave of his Country, but he bid adieu to the World, and ſo left the King once more <hi>Hors de page.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus Time and Fortune ſeem to have conſpir'd in vindicating the wrongs of this abuſed Prince, ridding him at once of thoſe two great Corrivals in Power, whoſe Authority had ſo far outweighed his, that they kept him in the condition of a Minor, till they had made the People believe him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient for Government; the one being remov'd beyond all poſſibility, the other beyond all probability of Return: whereby he became ſo much at eaſe in his own thoughts, that being upon the wing again, he thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf not only Maſter of himſelf, but of every body elſe; and now deſpiſing all after-claps, he ſeized upon all the Dukes Eſtate to his own uſe, which as it look'd like a Revenge now he was dead, that might have paſt for a piece of Juſtice if he had been living, ſo it gave many cauſe to pity the Duke his Son, who otherwiſe could have been well enough content never to have ſeen him more. Neither was this the worſt on't, but apprehending from what the King did to him, what poſſibly he might do to any of them, they made his particular ſuffering the ground of their Publick Reſentment, which <hi>Hereford</hi> took upon the firſt bound, and made that good uſe of it, that when he came after to claim the Crown, that it appear'd the beſt colour of Right he had was from this wrong, whereof yet the King was no way ſenſible, who (as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) deſpiſing all dangers at home, directed all his Caution to thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad only, taking with him young <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> the Duke of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reford</hi>'s, and ſince his Fathers Death, Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi>'s Son and Heir, into <hi>Ireland,</hi> whither he went to ſuppreſs ſome Rebels. This, however it ſeem'd to be an occaſion of Glory which the Bravery of his Youth could not ſuffer him to pretermit, whilſt thoſe petty Kings, who were eye witneſſes of his diſproportionate Power, taught their undiſciplin'd People Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, by the Example of their own Submiſſion; yet it prov'd an empty Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation, and ſo much more fatal in the Conſequence, by how much it was ſcarce poſſible to conceal, much leſs recover his Error, till the Exil'd Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> took his advantage of it, who finding him out of his Circle, return'd into <hi>England</hi> with that ſpeed, as if he had been afraid
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:51478:135"/> leſt Fortune ſhould change her mind before he could change his condition.</p>
               <p>Great was the concourſe of People that congratulated his Arrival, neither was their confluence leſs conſiderable for Quality then Number: the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> (baniſh'd for being one of the Confederates with the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter</hi>) the Earls of <hi>Northumberland, Weſtmoreland, Darby,</hi> and <hi>Warwick,</hi> the Lords <hi>Willoughby, Roſs, Darcy, Beaumont,</hi> and divers others, beſides Knights and Eſquires of great Repute in their Countries, who offer'd to ſerve him with their Lives and Fortunes: and as they mov'd they increas'd ſo faſt, that the Duke of <hi>York</hi> (left Regent during the Kings abſence) thought it convenient to attend him at <hi>Berclay</hi> Caſtle, and from thence to <hi>Briſtow,</hi> where the firſt Tragedy began; for there finding the Earl of <hi>Wiltſhire</hi> the Lord High Treaſurer, with Sir <hi>Henry Ewin,</hi> Sir <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Buſſy,</hi> both men of great note of the Kings party, they arraign'd them there for miſgoverning of the King, and having ſmote off their Heads, proceeded to impriſon the Biſhop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> Sir <hi>William Elmeham,</hi> Sir <hi>Walter Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh,</hi> and divers others upon the ſame account, ſetting up a direct Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which continued ſix Weeks before the King (by reaſon of contrary winds) heard any thing of it.</p>
               <p>Upon the firſt notice given him, he made a ſhew of being ſo little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd at it, that he declar'd he would not ſtir out of <hi>Dublin,</hi> till all things fitting for his Royal Equipage were made ready: but underſtanding after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that they had ſeiz'd ſeveral of his Caſtles, he ſent over the Earl of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury</hi> to make ready an Army againſt his landing, promiſing to follow him in ſix dayes after; but the Wind, or rather his Mind, changing, the Earls Forces (believing he might be dead) disbanded again, and left their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate General to himſelf. Eighteen dayes after this the King arriv'd, who finding how things ſtood, for they had taken off the Heads of ſeveral of his chief Councellors, impriſon'd the principalleſt of his Friends, and gotten the poſſeſſion of many of his ſtrong Forts and Caſtles, his Heart ſo fail'd him on the ſudden, that he immediately gave Command to the Army that was with him to Disband: and ſo degenerate were his Fears, that when he could not prevail with them to quit him (for they all reſolv'd to dye in his Defence, and being mov'd with no leſs Pity then Duty to ſee him ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, ſolemnly vow'd never to leave him) he moſt wretchedly gave them the Temptation to break their Faith, by leaving them firſt, withdrawing himſelf by night unknown to <hi>Conway</hi> Caſtle, where he underſtood the Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> was. But as a King can no more hide himſelf then the Sun, which however eclipſed, cannot be loſt, ſo it was not long ere the Duke of <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> found him out, and drawing his Forces to <hi>Cheſter,</hi> ſent from thence the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> to aſſure him of his Faith and Homage, upon Condition he would call a free Parliament, and there permit Juſtice to be done to him.</p>
               <p>Here Fortune ſeems to have made one ſtand more, to give him time, if poſſible, to recover himſelf; but he inſtead of giving an Anſwer worthy the Dignity of a King, did what was indeed unworthy a Private man, begging of the Earl to interpoſe with the Duke for him, that he might only have an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable Allowance to lead a private life, depoſing himſelf unexpectedly before t'other could have the time and opportunity, however he might have the thought to do it ſolemnly. The notice hereof did not a little ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize the Duke, when he heard of it, who doubting leaſt there was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more in it then he perceiv'd, wiſely kept himſelf within the bounds of ſeeming Obedience, and treated his Majeſty with all imaginable reſpect, till they arrived at <hi>London:</hi> then under pretence of ſecuring him, he lodg'd him
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:51478:135"/> in the <hi>Tower,</hi> where he made him the Inſtrument of his own deſtruction, by calling a Parliament that had no other buſineſs but to arraign his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and impeach him; and accordingly Articles were drawn up againſt him, which ſhew how ſmall a matter turns the Scale when Power is put into the Ballance againſt Juſtice. The chief of them were as followeth;
<list>
                     <item>1. <hi>That he had been very profuſe</hi> [a very grievous Crime in a King ſo young.]</item>
                     <item>2. <hi>That he had put ſome to death</hi> [that conſpired to depoſe him.]</item>
                     <item>3. <hi>That he had borrowed more money then he was well able to pay</hi> [the firſt King that ever loſt his Crown for being in Debt, and yet was not to be ſaid he was altogether a Bankrupt, that had in his Coffers when he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the value of Seven hundred thouſand pounds.]</item>
                     <item>4. <hi>That he ſaid the Law was in his Breaſt and Head</hi> [and perhaps the Lawyers would have made it good if they durſt, who have given it for an Axiome of the Law, that the King is <hi>Caput, Principium, &amp; Finis Juſtitiae.</hi>]</item>
                     <item>5. <hi>That he chang'd Knights and Burgeſſes of Parliament at his pleaſure</hi> [by making thoſe Peers of the Realm whom he thought worthy the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.]</item>
                     <item>6. <hi>That he ſaid the Lives and Goods of his Subjects were under his power]</hi> [which ſhews what confidence he had in their Loyalty and good Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.]</item>
                     <item>7. <hi>That he order'd an Impeachment againſt thoſe Lords that took upon them the Government by Authority of Parliament</hi> [Indeavouring to reduce thoſe under the Law that had ſo apparently broken through all Law.]</item>
                     <item>8. <hi>That in the management of that Affair he conſulted with all the Judges</hi> [Whereas it had been fitter perhaps to have conſulted with all the Sword-men of his Kingdom.]</item>
                     <item>9. <hi>That he caus'd his Uncle</hi> Glouceſter <hi>to be made away privately at</hi> Calais [When he found he had not power to take him off publickly at home.]</item>
                     <item>10. <hi>That he took off the Earl of</hi> Arundel<hi>'s Head, notwithſtanding a Charter of Pardon given him but a little before</hi> [Finding that he continued to abuſe his Favour by carrying on the old Conſpiracy.]</item>
                     <item>11. <hi>That he defended himſelf with Force</hi> [When the Lords aſſail'd him with Force.]</item>
                     <item>12. <hi>That though he had made Proclamation that the Lords whom he Arre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, were not Arreſted for any Crime of Treaſon, yet</hi> [when he was better inform'd by his Councel] <hi>he laid Treaſon to their Charge</hi> [and prov'd it.]</item>
                     <item>13. <hi>That he grievouſly Fined thoſe that took part with the Lords againſt him</hi> [Which being paid out of the Eſtates forfeited to him, was a great Diſcouragement to all honeſt men that ſhould ever have a mind to turn Rebels afterwards.]</item>
                     <item>14. <hi>That when he went over into</hi> Ireland, <hi>he carried with him the Plate and Jewels of the Kingdom</hi> [Without asking any body leave, that he might appear as like a King there as he did here, which could not but be very diſpleaſing to them that would have him like one no where.]</item>

               </p>
               <p>Upon theſe ſcarce grievous Articles he was depos'd, or rather he depos'd himſelf (for the Duke who had laid the Foundation of his Hypocriſie lower then to fear any under-mining, refuſing (by the Example of his Grandfather) to accept the Crown, unleſs he would tender it to him) he became ſo hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:51478:136"/> not only to do ſo, but which was yet viler, made it his Suit to the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper to accept of it from his hand, and as it were brib'd him with the Signet on his own Finger, which he deliver'd as a Seal, to ratifie his volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Reſignation.</p>
               <p>Strange Metamorphoſis! When the Lion, inſtead of indeavouring to take that noble Revenge, which makes all the Herd to tremble, as often as they ſee him offended, crouches and fawns like a Dog on him that beat him. Who was not tempted to quit his Allegiance, that ſaw their King thus turn Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to himſelf, making good the diſmal Preſage of that River, which but a little before, to the amazement of all men, turn'd its natural Courſe, and left the Channel dry; forgetting the miſerable Example of his Great-grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, who hoping to ſave his Life by not ſtrugling for it, loſt it with more horror, and leſs pity.</p>
               <p>Who knows not that the Priſons of Princes are their Graves, from whence they ne're return, till the general Reſurrection. The Uſurper could not ſleep at all after the Reſignation, till the depos'd King ſlept his laſt, the Wrong that he had done him beating a continual Alarm upon his Conſcience: neither could he eat his meat with alacrity, but ſighing as he ſate at Table, bemoan'd his having no Friend ſo faithful, or rather ſo faithleſs, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him from his Fears, leaving thoſe about him to gueſs what he meant. And no ſooner did theſe Thoughts of his take vent, but a ready Paracide taking his Cue to be the Executioner of his black purpoſe, haſted unbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to the place where the Captive King was, and tim'd his Treaſon ſo near to that of his Order, as to take him off juſt as he was at meat, aſſailing him with eight Ruffians arm'd with Holberts, four of which this wretched King kill'd before he ſunk, and poſſibly had deliver'd himſelf from the reſt, had not their Captain Paracide, Sir <hi>Pierce Exon</hi> (whoſe Name for Infamy ſake muſt never be forgotten) come behind him and beat out his Brains with a Pole-Axe.</p>
               <p>Thus fell <hi>Richard</hi> the Second as his Great-grand-father <hi>Edward</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and both as unhappily as their Anceſtors <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond long before: neither of whom dyed a dry death; the firſt being kill'd by his own Servant, t'other by his own Sons. And whether there was any thing fatal in that Number, I know not, but ſo it was that the Seconds of thoſe Kings amongſt the <hi>Danes</hi> were not much more fortunate. <hi>Eric</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, <hi>Anlaff</hi> the Second, and <hi>Canute</hi> the Second, all came, as well as thoſe amongſt the <hi>Normans,</hi> to untimely Ends: the firſt being butcher'd by the hands of his own Sons; the ſecond kill'd upon a miſtake by one of his own Domeſticks; and the laſt made as it were <hi>Felo de ſe,</hi> having drunk himſelf ſo dead, that he fell down with the Cup at his Noſe. And as amongſt the <hi>Normans</hi> and <hi>Danes,</hi> ſo 'tis obſervable amongſt the Engliſh Monarchs, that <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, thereupon ſurnam'd th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>However, none of theſe were yet ſo unfortunate as this King, who being ſo unwilling and unfit to dye, yet contributed moſt to his own Death.</p>

               <p>And 'tis obſervable that he claim'd in the name of <hi>the Father,</hi> not of his Father; for thereby hung a Tale, his own Father being but the fourth Son, whereas King <hi>Richard</hi>'s Father was the firſt Son of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third.

               <p>Such was his power that no man contradicted him, Heaven having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed that he ſhould contradict himſelf: for at the ſame time he made out his Title by Deſcent, he acknowledged that he came in by Conqueſt, aſſuring the People that every one ſhould enjoy his own, as freely as in times of <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Succeſſion</hi> (they are his own words) but when he came to treat with For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Princes, that were as well vers'd in the nature of Politick Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries as himſelf, he pretended then to be choſen by the unanimous Conſent and Election of the People; to whom, that he might appear reſtor'd as by Divine Providence, he appointed the day of his Coronation to be upon the very ſame day, wherein the year before he had been Baniſhed: and to hold up the Cheat, he was anointed with an Oyl, which (as 'twas pretended) was deliver'd to his Father, together with this Propheſie, <hi>That all the Kings that receiv'd their Chriſme from it ſhould be Champions of the Church;</hi> which (as the Legend holds forth) coming by chance to the hands of King <hi>Richard,</hi> as he was going for <hi>Ireland,</hi> he would have been anointed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, had not the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> diſſwaded him from it, as not being lawful to be anointed twice; however he was reſolv'd to intitle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſelf ſo far to the vertue of it, as to ſtile himſelf <hi>Defenſor Fidei.</hi>

                        <p>THE matter now propounded is of marvellous weight and conſequence, wherein there are two Points chiefly to be conſidered: the firſt, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther King <hi>Richard</hi> be ſufficiently put out of his Throne: the ſecond, Whether the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> be lawfully taken in. For the firſt; How can that be ſufficiently done, when there is no Power ſufficient to do it? The Parliament cannot do it, for the King is Head of the Parliament: and can the Body pull down the Head. You will ſay, but the Head may bow it ſelf down, and ſo may the King reſign. It is true: but of what Force is that that is done by Force; and who knows not that King <hi>Richard</hi>'s Reſignation was no other. But ſuppoſe he be lawfully out, yet how comes the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in? If you ſay by Conqueſt, you ſpeak Treaſon: for what Conqueſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Arms; and can a Subject take Arms againſt his lawful Soveraign, and not be Treaſon: if ſo, then whoever Arms againſt him ſucceſsfully, does it right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; and what hope of Peace at this rate. If you ſay by Election of State, you ſpeak not Reaſon: For what power hath the State to Elect, while any is living that hath Right to ſucceed? but ſuch a Succeſſor is not the Earl of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter,</hi> as deſcended from <hi>Edmund Crouchback,</hi> the elder Son of <hi>Henry</hi> the

               <p>Thoſe laſt words expreſs'd a Zeal that ſeem'd to have ſomething of the ſame effect as that of Lightning, which is ſaid to melt the Sword without ſo much as ſingeing the Scabard: For however no body that heard him, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peard to be warm by what he ſaid, yet a ſecret Fire was ſhot into many of their Breaſts, that after it came to be thorowly kindled in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, could not be extinguiſh'd, no not with Blood: ſo that they continued their Reſentments not for their own Lives only, but intail'd the Quarrel upon their Poſterity, even untill the Houſe of <hi>Clarence</hi> recover'd their Right in the third Generation after.</p>
               <p>Now as a Clergy-man firſt declar'd againſt this King, ſo a Clergy-man firſt Ingaged againſt him, without conſidering his holy Unction, which made him the great Champion of the Church (for however the Church-men are willing that others ſhould belive their Miracles, themſelves do not) this was the politick Abbot of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> a great Book-ſtates-man, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited ſeveral of the Chief Nobility into a Combination to take away his Life (ſo that <hi>Killing no Murther,</hi> is no Modern Tenet) and admitting what he ſuſpected only, there might be ſome reaſon for it; for who would not diſpatch an Enemy to God, the King, and the Church, one that therefore had unduly made himſelf King, that he might rob the great King of Kings of his due: the ground of this Jealouſie was upon certain words utter'd in the Abbots hearing, whilſt he was Duke of <hi>Hereford; viz.

The Duke of <hi>Albemarle</hi> in his way to <hi>Oxford,</hi> gave a needleſs viſit to his Father the
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:51478:138"/> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> who ſitting at the Table, chanced to ſpy ſomething like a Scrole or Parchment in his Sons Breaſt, whereupon he demanded what it was, and being not ſatisfied, ſuddenly he ſnatched it out with ſome paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: and upon view, finding it to be a Counterpart of the Indenture of Confederacy, he ordered his Horſes to be immediately made ready, with intention to go to the King, then at <hi>Windſor,</hi> to diſcover the Plot to him: but Youth being more active then Age, the Son got before him, and being himſelf the firſt Accuſer of himſelf, obtain'd his Pardon before his Father could come to prove him Guilty. The reſt of the Lords ſuſpecting by his not keeping time with them, that all was diſcover'd, fly to Arms, and ſetting up a Counterfeit <hi>Richard,</hi> who they pretended was eſcaped out of Priſon, they advanced to <hi>Windſor,</hi> where not finding the King (for he diſtruſting his Cauſe no leſs then his Power, had poſted before to <hi>London</hi>) they ſell upon deſperate Counſels: Some were of Opinion to march to <hi>Leeds</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> where King <hi>Richard</hi> till then was, and reſcue him out of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, before their Property was found out: Others thought it beſt to march directly up to <hi>London,</hi> and ſet upon the Uſurper before he were ready for his Defence: Some again adviſed to make a defenſive War, till they might have Aid from the King of <hi>France;</hi> which laſt Propoſal took place, as being moſt agreeable to that Irreſolution which their Guilt had brought upon them: and accordingly they retreated to <hi>Reading,</hi> and from thence marched down to <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> led by the hand of Deſtiny to receive there their fatal Doom, accelerated by an Accident not leſs unexpected then the former: For it ſo happen'd that the Grand Conſpirators coming out of their Camp to repoſe themſelves in the Town, the Duke of <hi>Surrey</hi> and Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> lying in one Inne, the Duke of <hi>Exeter</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> in another, the Bayliff of the Town (by what occaſion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, or by what Spirit directed is not known) with a Party of his Fellow Townes-men, ſet upon the two firſt, and ſtormed them in their Quarters, and without conſideration that their Army was ſo near, preſs'd ſo hard upon them, as to kill divers of their Retinue that defended the place, and indanger'd their Perſons ſo far, that the other two Lords, to divert their Fury, fired the Town in ſeveral places; but this not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing to give any Relief, they retired to bring their Army to reſcue them: but when they came there, they found the ſame means by which they deſign'd to ſave them, was the occaſion of their loſs; for thoſe in the Camp hearing the Noiſe of the Onſet, and ſeeing the Town in Flames, believing it could be nothing leſs then the Kings Forces that had done it, fled every one their ſeveral wayes, and ſo left the diſtreſſed Duke and Earl to mercy, who, like two Lions in a Toil baited with Dogs, dyed fighting, being rather wearied then vanquiſhed. And ſo King <hi>Henry,</hi> that never could get their Hearts living, had the good Fortune to recover their Heads being dead; and not long after found a way to reduce the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two under the ſame Fate, the Abbot ſuddenly dying upon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of their being diſſipated.</p>

               <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> hearing that <hi>Mortimer</hi> was taken, caus'd it to be bruted abroad that it was done with his own Conſent, and thereupon refus'd to redeem him: which ſo incens'd <hi>Henry,</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Hotſpur,</hi> Son of the firſt Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> of the Family of the <hi>Peircy</hi>'s, who had married his Daughter, that he, together with his Uncle the Earl of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter</hi> went over to <hi>Glendour,</hi> and entring into a Tripartite League with him, agreed to Depoſe the Depoſer, and divide the whole Kingdom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them. <hi>Wales</hi> (that is, all the Land beyond <hi>Severn</hi> Weſtward) was to be the Principality of <hi>Glendour.</hi> The Countries from <hi>Trent</hi> Northward, was the Lot of the <hi>Peircy</hi>'s; in memory whereof (the ſame being in the Geographical Form of a half Moon) they have ſince given the Creſcent for the Cognizance. All the reſt betwixt <hi>Severn</hi> and <hi>Trent</hi> Eaſtward and Southward, was conſign'd to <hi>Mortimer</hi> as his Portion. Thus the Dragon, the Lion, and the Wolf conſpired againſt the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lope, as he before againſt the Hart, his Soveraign; and taught by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, they aſſaulted him with Arms and Articles; the laſt perhaps more dangerous then the firſt, by how much they fought him at his own Weapons. The firſt Article was, <hi>That he had by his Letters procured Burgeſſes and Knights of Parliament to be choſen unduly:</hi> which being one of the Arrows out of his own Quiver, with which he had wounded King <hi>Richard</hi> before, troubled him not a little to ſee it return'd back upon himſelf. The ſecond Article was, <hi>That he had falſified the Oath made at his firſt landing, when he ſwore he came over for no other end but to recover his Inheritance.</hi> The third was, <hi>That he had not only taken Arms againſt his Soveraign, but having impriſon'd him, took firſt his Crown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and after his Life.</hi> And laſtly, <hi>That ever ſince his death, he had detain'd the Crown from the true Heir,</hi> Edmund <hi>Earl of</hi> March <hi>their Allie; for which Cauſes they defied him, and vowed his Deſtruction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was the ſecond Earth-quake in this Kings Reign, and ſo much more terrible then the former, in that it ſhuck the very Foundation of all his Greatneſs, by the noiſe of their Calumniations, wherewith as they bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd him ſeveral wayes, ſo they left him the proſpect of nothing but diſmal Confuſion to enſue. The Welch goaded him on the one ſide, the Scots on the other, thoſe Engliſh of <hi>Mortimer</hi>'s party, allarm'd him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way. But he that wanted not Confidence (whilſt he wanted a Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle) to aſpire to the Crown, when it was uncertain whether he ſhould ever get it or no; having got it, could not want Courage to keep it: and if he were able (being but a private man) to get it from a King, why ſhould he not believe himſelf more able (being now a King) to keep it from private men, eſpecially ſince he that had the Right in the firſt place had reſign'd it up to him; and he that had it in the ſecond place, had ſo far joyn'd in the final recovery of it, as to ſwear Allegiance to him, at the time of that Reſignation.</p>
               <p>Theſe Conſiderations were of that weight, that taking warning by King <hi>Richard,</hi> never to tempt any to forſake him, by forſaking himſelf, he reſolved to fall up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Peircy</hi>'s and he met, they being back'd by divers Scots, he by as many Engliſh: himſelf lead up that Wing which was againſt the Earl of <hi>Worceſter;</hi> his Son <hi>Henry,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> that againſt <hi>Hotſpur:</hi> this, as it was the firſt Battel the Prince was ever in, ſo here his Father taught him how to Rule, by ſhewing him how to fight. In either of which noble quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties there was never any Prince proud to be an apter Scholar then he, for he ſlew no leſs then thirty ſix men that day with his own hand, as thoſe who followed him obſerv'd; and as one that reſolv'd to be anointed with Blood before he came to be anointed with Oyl, he preſt into the midſt of the Battel, where he receiv'd ſeveral wounds, but one more remarkable then the reſt, by an Arrow in his Face, which either he had not time or patience to pluck out, till he had diſpatch'd his Rival <hi>Hotſpur,</hi> who was the only Enemy that vyed with him for hear of Youth and Courage. After this <hi>Worceſter</hi> and the <hi>Douglas</hi> ſubmitted to be his Priſoners; the Day being ſo clearly gain'd by his ſingle Conduct, that Fortune ſeems to have given it to him as an earneſt of thoſe greater Victories he was to have afterward. The fame of this ſignal overthrow made all <hi>Glendour</hi>'s For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſcatter ere the King could arrive upon the place to fight them, leaving him ſo much more a Victor, by having no Victory: For that in truth to have beaten him upon a fair diſpute, might have been underſtood to have been the effect of unequal Power; whereas the making him fly before he came near him, ſhews what apprehenſion t'other had of his invincible Courage. After this there was ſome trouble, but no great diſturbance given this King, by the French, the Attempts they made being either ſo faint or ſucceſsleſs, that they rather gave his Succeſſor an Invitation then a Provocation to invade them afterward. The Reſentments the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> had of the death of his Son and Brother, put him upon renewing the Rebellion, being back'd by the Arch-biſhop of <hi>York, Mow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray</hi> Earl-Marſhal, and others: but their Forces being disbanded by a trick, the two laſt were taken, and having juſtly forfeited their Heads, for that they had no more Brains in them then to believe the King would ſend a General againſt them of their own Faction; they were executed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly: but <hi>Northumberland</hi> himſelf eſcap'd into <hi>Scotland,</hi> being reſerv'd it ſeems by Deſtiny for a Nobler Death, he and the Lord <hi>Bardolph</hi> being both ſlain afterwards at <hi>Branham Moor,</hi> the laſt Battel that was fought in this Kings time; who being born to live no longer then whiles he was in Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moyls, and being inclin'd to make ſome expiation for all the Noble Blood he had ſhed to make good his Uſurpation, deſign'd at laſt to joyn Valour and Devotion in one Action together, which before he had uſed but ſingly, and accordingly took upon him the <hi>Cruſado,</hi> intending to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Decree of Deſtiny, which had appointed (as he was told by a Figure-Caſter) that he ſhould dye in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Neither could he want a ſufficient Train of Voluntiers, there being ſo many in that Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Age who were of the ſame Opinion with him that it was happier to periſh in that Holy War, then eſcape. This made the Prince his Son, who till this time had given himſelf the Liberty to commit ſuch Extravagancies as ill became any man, but leaſt a Prince, diſhonouring himſelf no leſs by the diſſolute Company he kept, then by the Debaucheries they ingaged him in, begin to take up, in expectation of the Succeſſion, and ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to his Father and the Laws, ſo govern'd himſelf, that the People might perceive he was at length become fit to govern them: but whiles prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were making for the Kings great Voyage to his long home at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> as he thought, the Journey prov'd neither ſo long nor chargeable as
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:51478:139"/> was expected; an Apoplectick fit ſeizing him whiles he was at his Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Abby of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> whereupon he was carried in immediately into the Abbots Houſe, and there unwittingly put to Bed in that Chamber which they call'd <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> which, as ſoon as he underſtood, and came thereby to unriddle the place of his Death, he was ſo wounded with the context, that he never recover'd it, but languiſhing, dyed not long after; having firſt had a taſte of Divine vengeance, in ſeeing himſelf depoſed in a manner by his own Son, before he was dead; who finding him in one of his Fits, and (as 'twas thought) breathleſs, took the Crown from off his Pillow (where he kept it all his Sickneſs, as that the very ſight whereof was a kind of reſtorative to him) which however it was return'd again with unfeigned humility, yet the miſs of it but for that moment only, gave ſuch a check to his Conſcience, that before he could bequeath it to his Son for good and all, as we ſay, he could not but acknowledge how little Right he had to it; and dying, ſubmitted his Title to him that is the only Judge of injured Kings.</p>

This Meſſage as it was the higheſt that ever was ſent to any free Prince, ſo he intruſted it to thoſe of higheſt Credit and Truſt about him: theſe were his Uncle the Duke of <hi>Exeter,</hi> a man of great eſteem as well as of great Name, the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Dublin,</hi> a very politick Prelate, the Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> a man at Arms, the Lord High Admiral, and the Biſhop of <hi>Norwich;</hi> the firſt as much renown'd for his Courage, as the laſt for his Contrivances, to whom for the greater ſtate there was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a Guard of five hundred Horſe to attend them.</p>
               <p>The Report of this great Embaſſy as it arriv'd before them, ſo it made ſuch a Report throughout all this ſide of the World, that all the Neighbour Princes, like liſſening Deer when they hear the noyſe of Huntſmen in the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:51478:140"/> Woods, began to take the Alarm, and conſider which ſide to ſly to; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo that <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> never made any long War upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but they ingaged all Chriſtendom with them: However, the Court of <hi>France</hi> pretending themſelves ignorant of the Occaſion of their coming, diſſembled their diſdain, and treated them with that magnificence, as if they had deſign'd to Complement them out of their buſineſs: but after the Meſſage was delivered with that faithful boldneſs that became ſo great an Affair, they were all in that confuſion, that it was hard to judge whether they were more aſhamed, incenſed, or afraid; giving ſuch a return as ſeem'd neither compatible with the honour, wiſdom, or courage of ſo renown'd a People as they are: For firſt, as they did neither deny nor allow the Kings Title, but ſaid they would make Anſwer by Ambaſſadours of their own: So in the next place they were ſo haſty in their Counſels, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch of their Ambaſſadors hither, that they arriv'd in <hi>England</hi> almoſt as ſoon as thoſe ſent hence. And laſtly, at the ſame time they deſired Peace, and offer'd to buy it with the tender of ſome Towns, they gave the King an Affront which was a greater Provocation then the denyal of ten ſuch Kingdoms: for the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> who in reſpect of the King his Fathers ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (I might rather ſay weakneſs) managed the State, affecting the honour to give the firſt Box, or perhaps deſiring to make any other Quarrel the ground of the approaching War, which he foreſaw was not to be preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, rather then that of the Title which had been already ſo fatally bandi'd, ſcornfully ſent the King a Preſent of Tenis-balls, which being of no value, nor reckoning, worthy ſo great a Princes acceptance, or his recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, could have no other meaning or interpretation, but, as one ſhould ſay, he knew better how to uſe them then Bullets. The King, whoſe Wit was as keen as t'others Sword, return'd him this Anſwer, <hi>That in requital of his fine Preſent of Tenis-balls, he would ſend him ſuch Balls, as he ſhould not dare to hold up his Racket againſt them.</hi> Neither was he worſe then his word, however his preparations ſeem'd very diſproportionable for ſo great a Work. For the Army he landed was no more but ſix thouſand Horſe and twenty four thouſand Foot: a Train ſo inconſiderable, and by the <hi>Daulphin</hi> judg'd to be ſo deſpicable, that he thought not fit to come down himſelf in Perſon to take any view of them, for fear he ſhould fright them out of the Country too ſoon, but ſent ſome rude Peaſants to attend their Motion, who, incouraged by ſome of the Troops of the neareſt Garriſons, as little underſtanding the danger they were ingaged in, as they did the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Enemy they were ingaged with, fell in upon the Rear of his Camp: but as Village Curs, which fiercely ſet upon all Strangers, having the leaſt Rebuke with a Stone or a Cudgel, retreat home whining with their Tails betwixt their Legs, ſo they having a Repulſe given them ran away, and made ſuch Out-cries as diſhearten'd the Souldiers that were to ſecond them ſo much, that after that he marched without any Reſiſtance as far as <hi>Callice:</hi> Neither indeed ſaw he any Enemy till he came to give Battel to the united Forces of <hi>France</hi> at that famous Field of <hi>Agencourt,</hi> where, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he was out-numbred by the <hi>French</hi> above five for one, he fought them with that Reſolution, as made himſelf Maſter of more Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners then he had men in his Camp to keep them; an Occaſion Fortune gave him to ſhew at once her Cruelty and his Mercy: who, whilſt he might have kill'd did not; but when he ſhould not, was forc'd to be cruel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond almoſt all Example: for as he gave Quarter in the beginning of the Battel to all that ask'd it, his Clemency and Gentleneſs being ſuch that (as he was then pleas'd to declare) he conſider'd them as his Subjects, not as his
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:51478:141"/> Captives. So being over-charged with their Priſoners Numbers, upon a ſudden and unexpected accident (however of no great Conſequence, if it had been rightfully underſtood) he was forc'd to write the diſmal Fate of <hi>France</hi> in cold Blood, and in order to the ſaving life, deſtroy it. For as he was ſeeing his wounded men dreſt, having gotten an intire Victory, as he thought, and as afterward it proved, a ſudden out-cry alarm'd his Camp, occaſion'd by a new Aſſault of ſome <hi>French</hi> Troops, who being the firſt had quit the Field, were the firſt return'd into it again, in hopes by fighting with Boyes, to regain the honour they loſt in refuſing to fight with men: theſe under the Leading of the Captain of <hi>Agencourt,</hi> ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Pages, Sutlers, and Laundreſſes, following the purſuit with that wonted noyſe, as if they would have the <hi>Engliſh</hi> think the whole Army was rally'd again, and chaſing them: Upon this the King caus'd all the ſcatter'd Arms and Arrows to be recollected, and his ſtakes to be new pitch'd, and put himſelf into a poſture of Defence: neither were the <hi>Engliſh</hi> only deceived by the Shreiks and Cries of thoſe miſerable People that fell into theſe mens hands, but all thoſe of the <hi>French</hi> likewiſe that were within hearing; inſomuch that the Earls of <hi>Marle</hi> and <hi>Falconbridge,</hi> who with ſix hundred men at Arms had all the while ſtood conceal'd to take the firſt advantage offer'd them, advanc'd upon the ſame miſtake, to reinforce the Battel, who ſeeming in the Night more then they were (for indeed the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſuppos'd it the whole Body of the <hi>French</hi> Army return'd again upon them) the King not knowing how to diſperſe them, commanded all the Priſoners to be forthwith ſlain, ſave ſome few Perſons of Note, who for common ſecurity were bound back to back.</p>
               <p>This made it a bloody Victory indeed, that look'd more like a Miracle before, there being ten thouſand of the Enemy ſlain, and (if we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>Caxton</hi>) not above twenty ſix of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſide. <hi>P. Aemilius,</hi> their own Hiſtorian, ſaith not above ten private Souldiers, two Knights, and two Lords, which were the Duke of <hi>York</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> that bore no proportion to the five hundred Knights and twenty ſix Lords loſt on the other ſide, amongſt whom the <hi>Daulphin</hi> himſelf may be reckon'd for one, though he died not on the place; for ſtruck with the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of this loſs, he ſurviv'd it a very little time after. However, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> got only the glory of being Victors, but not a foot of ground more then they had before; Providence having ſo ordained that King <hi>Henry</hi> ſhould only gain a Name in Arms by his firſt Expedition, that upon his next Arrival they might the more contentedly give him up the Crown, and with it, her that dazled his Eyes more then all the Jewels he found there, the incomparable Lady <hi>Katherine,</hi> to whoſe Excellency of Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was added that of Innocence, which made her yet more deſirable for a Wife, then the other made her for a Miſtreſs.</p>
               <p>Not long after this Battel he return'd home, as if to give and take breath; and during the time of his ſtay here, the Emperour <hi>Sigiſmund,</hi> attended by the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Rheimes,</hi> gave him a perſonal Viſit, in hope to have made a Peace betwixt the two Kings, at leaſt 'twas ſo pretended: but time that is the beſt Expoſitor of all great Actions, ſhews his coming to have had ſome further deſign in it; otherwiſe his Mediation had not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded (as it did) in a League Offenſive and Defenſive, leaving King <hi>Henry</hi> to follow Providence in the purſuit of his predeſtin'd Conqueſt, who, upon his ſecond Expedition invaded <hi>Normandy,</hi> and having in a ſhort time taken in the City of <hi>Caen,</hi> with moſt of the leſſer <hi>Villes,</hi> came at laſt to that proud Town of <hi>Roan,</hi> which ſpent him ſome time longer then
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:51478:141"/> he expected in taking it: But it prov'd not time loſt; for the Eſſay they made of their own Strength and Courage (being at the beginning of the Seige no leſs then two thouſand Perſons in it, moſt able to make Defence) gave the World ſuch proof of his, that he gain'd much more in Intereſt then he loſt, in recovering the Principal, there being ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to him upon the Fame of taking in that great City, <hi>Hunflew, Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, Devilliers, Ewe, New-caſtle, Vernon, Mant, La Roch, Gwyon,</hi> and indeed the beſt, if not the moſt part of that rich Province, the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Inheritance of his Progenitors.</p>
               <p>That which contributed much to his Succeſs, was the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the new <hi>Daulphin,</hi> and the old Duke of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> The firſt, as much diſdaining that the other ſhould have the Government of the King, who was taken with a frenzy that made him incapable of Buſineſs, as the other that he ſhould have the Government of the Kingdom, either thinking himſelf immediately concerned in the danger of the others Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, neglected the Publick to abet their Private Factions. The Queen Mother, who could not be a Neuter, took part with the Duke, into whoſe hands ſhe put the King, purpoſely to curb the <hi>Daulphins</hi> pride, (that had moſt inſolently ſeiz'd and detain'd her Jewels, Plate and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney) conteſting for the Superiority without regard to him that put fair for ſubduing both. But the noiſe of King <hi>Henry</hi>'s unexpected Succeſs in ſubduing almoſt all <hi>Normandy,</hi> awaken'd them; and now, when 'twas too late, they reconcil'd to each other in hopes to drive back the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh:</hi> But finding that they had taken rooting in too many places to be ſuddenly over-turn'd, the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> propoſes a Perſonal Treaty betwixt the two Kings: whither came King <hi>Henry,</hi> attended by his Brothers the Dukes of <hi>Clarence</hi> and <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> his Coſin the Duke of <hi>Exeter,</hi> his Uncle the Cardinal <hi>Beauford,</hi> the Earls of <hi>March</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury,</hi> and a thouſand Men at Arms; being met by the Queen Regent and her Governour, the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> the Earl of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſeveral other Perſons of the greateſt Quality, as well Ladies as Lords, who were obliged to attend her. Amongſt the reſt (and therefore indeed did the reſt come that they might be as Foyls to her) appear'd the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs <hi>Katherine,</hi> deſign'd (as it fell out after) to conquer the Conqueror: A Lady of that Perfection both of Body and Mind, that had ſhe not been the Daughter of a King, ſhe had yet been fit to be the Wife of one. No ſooner did King <hi>Henry</hi> look upon her, but his Heart ſeem'd to melt within his Breaſt, no Arms being proof againſt the Darts ſhe ſhot; yet his Wiſdom had ſo much the better of his Affection, that he conceal'd his Paſſion both from her, and the Obſervation of the <hi>French</hi> Lords, till the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> trifling with him, upon preſumption of her Charms, provok'd him to give a Reply more like an <hi>Engliſh</hi> then a <hi>French</hi> King, and created ſuch a Diſtaſt as broke off the preſent Treaty.</p>
               <p>Happy had it been for that Duke if he had cloſed with him, although his Enemy, rather then agree (as he did) with his Friend the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> who finding his turn ſerv'd by him in breaking off the Treaty, having no further uſe of his Authority, rewarded his Service with a Poniard; which Butchery being perform'd in the view of all the Peers of <hi>France,</hi> was look'd on like a piece of Juſtice rather then of Tyranny, in reſpect the Duke himſelf had but a little before caus'd <hi>Lewis</hi> Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi> to be taken off in the like barbarous manner. Succeſſor to this ſlain Duke both in his Eſtate and Authority was his Son <hi>Philip</hi> Earl of <hi>Carolois:</hi> a Politick Prince and Temperate, who finding it would be an unequal
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:51478:142"/> Conteſt between him and the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> if he ſhould avowedly indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to revenge his Fathers blood; wiſely promoted Overtures of Peace betwixt the two Crowns, in order to the doing that Execution by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hand, which his own was too weak to perform. Ambaſſadours were thereupon ſent to King <hi>Henry,</hi> who having been all this while a Martyr to Love, was no longer able to indure the Flames within his Breaſt, but giving it vent, told the Ambaſſadours he would not credit their Propoſitions, unleſs the Lady <hi>Katherine</hi> would joyn with them, whoſe Innocency he knew would never abuſe him.

               <p>Upon his Marriage with her, he was publiſhed Regent of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Heir apparent to the Crown, the Articles being publiſhed in both Realms, and the two Kings and all their Nobility Sworn to the obſervance of them; only the <hi>Daulphin</hi> ſtood out in utter Defiance both of his Right and Power. Againſt him therefore the two Kings, his Father and Brother, together with the King of <hi>Scots</hi> (who was newly arrived) the young Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Clarence, Glouceſter,</hi> and <hi>Bedford,</hi> and twenty one Earls, forty five Barons, and Knights and Eſquires <hi>ſans nombre,</hi> advanc'd with an Army of <hi>French, Engliſh, Scotch</hi> and <hi>Iriſh,</hi> to the number of ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand, if the Hiſtorians of that time may be credited; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken in all the Towns and Places that denied to yield, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to <hi>Paris,</hi> where King <hi>Henry</hi> (the Articles being ratified the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, and a Counterpart ſent into <hi>England</hi>) began to exerciſe his Regency, by Coyning of Money with the Arms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> on it; placing and diſplacing of Officers; making new Laws and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts; and laſtly, awarding Proceſs againſt the <hi>Daulphin</hi> to appear at the Marble Table, to anſwer for the Murther of the Duke of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> But being willing to ſhew his Queen how great a King he was before ſhe brought him that Kingdom, he left his Brother <hi>Clarence</hi> his Lieutenant General there, and brought her over into <hi>England,</hi> where he ſpent ſome time in the Adminiſtration of Juſtice, and performing ſuch Acts of Peace, as ſpoke him no leſs expert in the knowledge of governing, then in that of getting a Kingdom.</p>
               <p>But he had not been long here, before he received the ſad News of the death of his Brother <hi>Clarence,</hi> who betrayed by the Duke of <hi>Alan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> Contrivance into an Ambuſcade, was ſlain, together with the Earls of <hi>Tankervile, Somerſet, Suffolk,</hi> and <hi>Perch,</hi> and about two thouſand Common Souldiers: whereupon he deputed the Earl of <hi>Mortaine</hi> in his room, and not long after went back again himſelf with his Brother <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> to reinforce the War, taking in all the Fortreſſes in the Iſle of <hi>France,</hi> in <hi>Lovaine, Bry,</hi> and <hi>Champagne:</hi> during which time the <hi>Daul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin</hi> was not idle, but induſtrious to regain Fortunes ſavour, if it were poſſible, made many bold Attempts upon ſeveral places in poſſeſſion of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> But finding the <hi>Genius</hi> of our Nation to have the Predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:51478:142"/> over that of his own, he diverted his Fury upon the Duke of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy;</hi> betwixt whom and King <hi>Henry</hi> he put this difference, That as he dreaded the one, ſo he hated the other. Accordingly he laid Seige to <hi>Coſney,</hi> a Place not very conſiderable in it ſelf; but as it was a Town of the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi>'s. King <hi>Henry</hi> was ſo concern'd to relieve it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond any of his own, that he marched Night and Day to get up to the Enemy, and making over-haſty Journeys, over-heat himſelf with unuſual Travel, and fell ſo ſick, that he was fain to reſt himſelf at <hi>Senlis,</hi> and truſt to the Care of his Brother the Duke of <hi>Bedford</hi> to proſecute the Deſign, who relieved the Town, and forced the <hi>Daulphin</hi> to retreat, as he thought a great Looſer by the Seige, but it prov'd quite otherwiſe: For the loſs of the Town was nothing in compariſon of the loſs of King <hi>Henry,</hi> who died not long after; and which made his Death the more deplorable was, That he no ſooner left the World, but Fortune left the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> whereof having ſome Prophetick Revelation, 'tis thought the knowledge thereof might not be the leaſt reaſon of ſhortning his Dayes, by adding to the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of his Diſtemper: For 'tis credibly reported, that at the News of the Birth of his Son <hi>Henry,</hi> born at <hi>Windſor,</hi> himſelf being then in <hi>France,</hi> even wearied with continual Victories, he cryed out in a Prophetick Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Good Lord,</hi> Henry <hi>of</hi> Monmouth <hi>ſhall ſmall time Reign and get much, and</hi> Henry <hi>of</hi> Windſor <hi>ſhall long time Reign and loſe all; but Gods will be done.</hi> Which ſaying has given occaſion to ſome to magnifie his Memory a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all the Kings that were before him, not to ſay all that came after him, in that he was in ſome ſenſe both King, Prieſt, and Prophet.</p>

A temper neither happy for the times nor himſelf;
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:51478:143"/> for had he had leſs Phlegme and more Cholar, leſs of the Dove-like In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, and more of the Serpentine ſubtilty, 'tis probable he had not only been happier whilſt he liv'd, but more reſpected after he was dead: whereas now, notwithſtanding all his Indulgence to the Church and Church-men, there was none of them ſo grateful as to give him after he was murther'd) Chriſtian Burial, but left him to be interr'd without Prieſt or Prayer, without Torch or Taper, Maſs or Mourner; indeed ſo without any regard to his Perſon and Pre-eminence, that if his Obſequies were any whit better then that which holy Writ calls the Burial of an Aſs, yet were they ſuch, that his very Competitor <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, who denied him the Rights of Majeſty living, thought him too much wronged being dead, that to him (ſome kind of ſatisfaction) he was himſelf at the charge of building him a Monument.</p>
               <p>The beginning of his Reign, which every Body expected to have been the worſt, and like to prove the moſt unſucceſsful part in reſpect of his Minority (being but Nine Months old when he was crown'd) happen'd to be the beſt and moſt proſperous, there being a plentiful ſtock of brave men left to ſpend upon, who behaved themſelves ſo uprightly and carefully, that it appear'd the Truſt repos'd in them by the Father, had made a ſtrong Impreſſion of Love and Loyalty to the Son. The Duke of <hi>Bedford</hi> had the Regency of <hi>France;</hi> the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England;</hi> the Duke of <hi>Exeter</hi> and the Cardinal <hi>Beauford</hi> had the Charge of his Perſon: and each of theſe, whilſt they ſtood as free Agents, and counterpoiz'd each others Greatneſs, kept the Scale <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>even, maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Sword what was got by the Sword. But after the King came to be declar'd Major, and at his own diſpoſe, having not the Judgment to conceal his own Weakneſs, much leſs to controul their Potency, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Ambition broke in upon the Government, and made ſuch a Rupture in the Reputation of their former Succeſſes, that the <hi>French</hi> King back'd by many Seconds (who yet were not ſo much his Friends, as Enemies to the <hi>Engliſh</hi>) took that advantage to reinforce his Credit, and preſs'd ſo hard upon them, that all the well-built Frame of their <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi> crack'd from top to bottom.</p>
               <p>However there were three fatal Breaches made in it before all fell to pieces: The firſt Flaw was occaſion'd by the Rupture betwixt the Duke of <hi>Bedford</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> who divided about a meer Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctillio of Honour, who ſhould firſt come to the place where they had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to treat of the Differences betwixt them. The Duke of <hi>Bedford</hi> thought the other ought to attend his coming, in reſpect he was Regent of <hi>France;</hi> t'other thought he ought rather to expect him, it being in his own Dominions where he was abſolute Soveraign: upon which they parted, the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> leſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Bedford</hi> not long after the World. And this unhappy King became ſo much the greater Sufferer, by how much the reparation of that loſs prov'd more fatal then the loſs it ſelf; for as it was as difficult, as neceſſary, to find out a good Succeſſor to that great Truſt, ſo he was not a little oppreſt by the Importunity of two Competitors, who being men of like Anger and Ambition, caus'd a more fatal Breach then the former. Theſe were the Dukes of <hi>Somerſet</hi> and <hi>York:</hi> the firſt Grandſon to <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> and Grandfather to <hi>Henry</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth; the laſt, yet greater, in reſpect of his Deſcent from <hi>Lyonel</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> being Head of the <hi>White-roſe</hi> Faction; both equal in Blood and Merit, either too Great to be diſpleas'd, much more too Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious to be pleas'd.</p>
               <pb n="268" facs="tcp:51478:144"/>
               <p>In this Conteſt the Duke of <hi>York</hi> got the Ball, and from his Succeſs concluded 'twas poſſible (as he did afterward) to get the Scepter too, being by the Mothers ſide the right Heir to <hi>Richard</hi> the Second: but the Duke of <hi>Somerſet</hi> reſolving to revenge his loſs by the hazard of looſing the whole, gave him ſo many Interruptions in his Diſpatch of that great Charge, that before he could arrive in <hi>France,</hi> the Pariſians had ſhuck off their Yoke, and by their Example, the Revolt became ſo general, that even the <hi>Normans</hi> themſelves (ever before firm to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>) were upon the point alſo of changing their Allegiance.</p>
               <p>The third and moſt fatal Breach, was that betwixt the Uncle and Nephew, the Cardinal <hi>Beauford</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter.</hi> The Duke charg'd the Cardinal with Affectation of Pre-eminence, even to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation of the Kings Prerogative and Contempt of his Laws: the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal not finding Matter to recriminate ſo Perſonally upon him himſelf, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd his other ſelf, to wit, his Wife, to be a Sorcereſs, and one that by Witchcraft attempted to take away the Kings Life: Which whether it were true or no, was ſo well managed, that her pretended Crime was in effect made his; for by the help of the Queen (to whom the King had been eſpouſed by advice of the Cardinal, and the Marquiſs, after made Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> his Creature, againſt the advice of this good Duke (for ſo the People call'd him) they prevail'd with the weak King, firſt to exclude him the Councel, after to deprive him of all Commands, and laſtly to take away his Life too; not foreſeeing (ſo improvident was their Malice) that as long as he liv'd, his Primogeniture (being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from the Fourth Son of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third) would have kept back the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Claim, that came from the Fifth Son. For his Death gave the firſt Occaſion of beginning that deſperate War betwixt the two alike cruel Houſes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> who ſo waſted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by Alternate Succeſſes, like Plants which cut in the Spring, bleed themſelves to death, that they left no Iſſue to inherit their dear-bought Titles, and were thereby neceſſitated for the ſame Reaſon to unite in the laſt, as they divided in the firſt place, to wit, to entail that fatal Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry upon their Poſterity, which they found to wither (do what they could) as the <hi>Roſes</hi> they gave for their Cognizances, which by being ſo often cut down, came at laſt to be over-topt by the <hi>Thiſtle</hi> of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Dukes of <hi>Somerſet</hi> and <hi>Suffolk</hi> being the two principal Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors that govern'd the Queen, who govern'd the King, and managed the whole Proſecution of the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter.</hi> The People after the Death of the Cardinal, who did not long Survive the Execution of that good Duke, for ſo they commonly call'd him, fixt their Mark of Evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors, and preſt ſo hard for their amoval from the King, that the Queen was forc'd, as commonly it falls out in ſuch Caſes, to let go her hold, and leave them to ſhift for themſelves. The laſt was the firſt fell into their Hands, who attempting to fly their Fury, being Impeached in Parliament, was taken at Sea and Executed according to the Popular way of Juſtice, without Ceremony or Sentence, by chopping off his Head on the ſide of a Boat.

Whereupon the Duke of <hi>York</hi> was forced to take off his Vizard, and own the Juſtice of his Complaint barefac'd, who having an Army rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſecond them, prevail'd ſo far with the Parliament as to get the Duke twice arreſted, but finding him to be ſtill releas'd as ſoon as they were up, who therefore were diſſolv'd to the end that he might be diſcharg'd; he advanced towards <hi>London</hi> to do himſelf, as he ſaid, and the Kingdome Right: But before he could paſs St. <hi>Albans</hi> the King met him and gave him Battel, wherein the unfortunate Duke of <hi>Somerſet</hi> gave the laſt Teſtimony of his Loyalty to the King, in the loſs of his Life, and the unhappy King the laſt Teſt of his Affection to him, by the loſs of his Liberty, being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to render himſelf a Priſoner to the Victor, who was ſo modeſt as not to declare his Title to the Crown, but contented himſelf to be by the good favour of the next Parliament, declared Protector only; and ſo moderate as to permit his two great Supporters, the Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> then Lord Chancellor, and the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> Captain of <hi>Callice,</hi> to ſhare with him for a while in the power, who making up a kind of <hi>Triumvirate</hi> for the time being, placed and diſplaced whom they pleaſed.

               <p>The principal Perſons for Quality, Power, and Intereſt that ſtuck to the King, were the young Duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Exeter</hi> and <hi>Buckingham,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Oxford, Northumberland, Shrewsbury, Pembroke, Ormond</hi> and <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> the Lords <hi>Clifford, Gray, Egremount, Dacres, Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, Scales, Awdley, Wells,</hi> &amp;c. who having muſter'd all the Forces they could make, incamped near <hi>Northampton:</hi> Thither came the Earl of <hi>March,</hi> Son and Heir to the Duke of <hi>York</hi> (his Father being then in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>) to give them Battel, aſſiſted by the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Warwick, Salisbury, Huntington, Devon, Eſſex, Kent, Lincoln,</hi> &amp;c. all men of great Name and Power, with whom were the Lords <hi>Faulconbridge, Scroop, Stamford, Stanley,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo fierce was the Encounter betwixt them, that in leſs then two hours above ten thouſand men loſt their Lives: amongſt whom the principal on the Kings ſide were the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> the Lords <hi>Egremount</hi> and <hi>Beaumont;</hi> the unfortunate King being made Priſoner the ſecond time, who by the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> was conveighed to the <hi>Tower.</hi> Upon which the Queen, taking with her the Prince and the young Duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> fled: The rumour of which Victory brought the Duke of <hi>York</hi> over, who laying aſide all diſguiſes, in the next Parliament (call'd for that purpoſe) p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="276" facs="tcp:51478:148"/> Clergy-man to be the Picklock of Priviledge, a grave State-drudge, and by his degree no worſe a man then an Arch biſhop, who having only ſo much Divinity as to know that Obedience was better then Sacrifice, ſo far per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, or rather terrified the diſconſolate Queen into a Complyance, that ſhe (conſulting with her Fears only) gave up the innocent Infant to his Grace, who thereby had the honour to be the third great Inſtrument in that great Treaſon that followed.</p>
               <p>The Monſter having thus got his deſired Prey within his own Denn, did not yet think fit to devour them immediately, but before he entred upon ſo ſolemn an act of horrour, as the plunging himſelf into that fathomleſs Gulf of Cruelty, he thought fit to wade in blood by degrees, that ſounding the depth of the danger as well as of the guilt he was to enter into, he might at the ſame time harden and ſecure himſelf. Firſt then he cut off all their Friends, beheading the Lord <hi>Rivers,</hi> Sir <hi>Anthony Woodvill,</hi> and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal perſons of the Queens Relations, upon pretence of treachery againſt his Perſon and Government, which being in ſome ſenſe true (for doubtleſs they meant to oppoſe his intended Uſurpation) he thought it a reaſonable Juſtification for taking their Lives. In the next place he charged the Queen her ſelf with Sorcery, making the poor Innocent <hi>Jane Shore</hi> to be her Hand-mate in the Inchantation; with whom the Lord <hi>Haſtings</hi> having had a known Familiarity from the time of the death of King <hi>Edward,</hi> he moſt maliciouſly deſign'd him to be their Accuſer, who ſcorning to aſſiſt him in ſuch dark purpoſes, was himſelf made a Conſpirator with them, being deſervedly executed as a Traytor, becauſe he refuſed to be one: his Execution following ſo cloſe upon his Sentence, and the Proclamation of his Treaſon ſo cloſe upon that, that at the reading of it in the Street, a ſtander by obſerving how fairly they had drawn the foul Charge againſt him, being ingroſſed at large in Parchment, he cried out aloud, That <hi>it was written by Prophecy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus having clear'd the Foundation, and ſufficiently tamper'd his Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar with blood, to make it more ſtrong and binding, he laid the Ground-work of his Uſurpation upon the Illegitimacy of the two young Princes; pretending that the King their Father was never lawfully married to the Queen their Mother, but was before God, Husband to the Lady <hi>Elizabeth Lucy.</hi> This, as it had ſomething of Truth in point of Fact (for 'tis ſaid he was betrothed to her) ſo being matter of Divinity in point of Right, it was agreed that a Chaplain to the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> (who was his great Confident, and bound to him by the ſtipulation of a Match betwixt their Children, and a promiſe of equal partition of the Treaſure of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom) ſhould open the Caſe at large in a Sermon at <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Croſs;</hi> who ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his Text from that place, where 'tis ſaid, <hi>that Baſtard Plants ſhall not Inherit,</hi> ſo over-acted his part, that he not only made King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but he himſelf a Baſtard too, and all the Children of his Father the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> the Protector only excepted, who he ſaid was the expreſs Image of his Father, and pre-ordained by God to the great Charge of the Kingly Office. But all this was delivered with ſo apparent flattery and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation, that not believing himſelf, 'tis no wonder the People gave ſo little credit to him, who inſtead of crying out thereupon (as 'twas ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected they ſhould) <hi>God ſave King</hi> Richard, cryed out, <hi>the Devil take the ſhameleſs Preacher.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſcorn put upon the Prieſt, or rather upon him, did not yet ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, but that two dayes after he ſent the Duke himſelf into the City, to ſee whether his Authority might move any thing more then the Doctors
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:51478:148"/> Eloquence, who confidently affirm'd to the Citizens at <hi>Guild-hall,</hi> That all the Nobility judging the Iſſue of King <hi>Edward</hi> ſpurious, had choſen him to ſucceed, and only expected a Declaration of their Conſents: But as it was not likely, that they who but two dayes before, could not be moved when they were told, the Lord from Heaven had made choice of him, ſhould now concur in the Election with any Lords on Earth, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could the Rhetorick of his Greatneſs prevail for any other confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then what was couched <hi>ſub alto ſilentio.</hi> This gave little ſatisfaction to his Lordſhip, for that he knew it would give none to his Maſter; and therefore rather then depart without ſomething like a Vote, he ſecretly ordered ſome few of his own Servants at the lower end of the Hall to caſt up their Caps, and cry, <hi>King Richard, King Richard:</hi> which impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of theirs, though it apparently abaſht the greateſt part of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany there, yet his graceleſs Grace taking it up at the firſt bound for an unanimous conſent, ſaid it was a goodly Cry, and ſuch as ſhew'd their u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal approbation; requiring thereupon the Mayor and his Fraternity to meet him the next day at the Protectors Court in <hi>Baynard</hi>'s Caſtle, in order to Petition him to accept their freely offer'd Subjection.</p>
               <p>And here I cannot but think it worth the notice (although we that have lived in theſe latter times have ſeen perhaps more exquiſite Scenes of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie) to obſerve the inſtability and levity of the common Peoples Faith, who (like the Sea to which they are compared) have their fluxes and refluxes of Loyalty. It was not two dayes ſince they ſhew'd as great Affections to the Son, as ever their Wives had to the Father, in attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to beat down the Pulpit about that Stone-Prieſts ears, that aſſaid to beat down his Title; anſwering his potent Patron, the Duke of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> with a Sullenneſs that ſhew'd no leſs contempt of his Dignity, then of the others Divinity. Yet after all this honeſt obſtinacy, the very next day after they Apoſtatized into that Compliance, as to ſuffer themſelves to be made meer Properties in that moſt ridiculous Pageantry of State, when the aforeſaid Duke made it a thing of ſuch great difficulty to get the Protector to ſhew himſelf to them out of a high Gallery, for nearer he was not to come, not knowing (as it was to be ſuppos'd) what the intent of their Addreſs was, until his Grace ſaluted his Highneſs with the tender of their Allegiance; and in a long Oration (by which ſpeaking for them, he rather ſpoke to them) declared that they were abundantly ſatisfied, not only in the Juſtice, but Neceſſity of his taking the Royal Authority upon him. At which the Uſurper ſtarted, being ſtruck dumb with paſſion for a while, but after he had conquer'd his Anger and Amazement, he, good Man, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to his wonted Clemency, and gently reproached the Duke his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin of Unkindneſs, telling him he little thought that he of all men would have moved him to the thing, that he knew of all things in the World he moſt declin'd, proteſting it was far from him to do ſuch wrong to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Brother, and his ſweet Children, and to his own upright Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: this he ſpoke trembling, as doubting the Multitude might cloſe with him, and cry <hi>Amen.</hi> But ſcarce were the words out of his Mouth, before the Duke, ſeemingly out of his Senſes, tranſported with a juſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation to ſee their profer'd Love ſcorn'd, reply'd like a truly Loyal Traytor; Sir, I muſt further add, that ſince it is ſo well known that your Brothers Children are Baſtards, they ſhall never be admitted to the Crown of <hi>England;</hi> and therefore if your Highneſs ſhall neither regard your ſelf nor us, ſo much, as to accept the Truſt, We are directly determin'd to confer it upon ſome one of the Houſe of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> that will have reſpect to
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:51478:149"/> the general Good. This made the Crocodile weep; and now acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging he was not born for himſelf, he ſo far deny'd himſelf, as to accept the honour thruſt upon him by the giddy Multitude, who ecchoing to the Duke their Speaker, cry'd out all (as if it had been with one voice) <hi>God ſave King</hi> Richard, <hi>God ſave King</hi> Richard. This made him deſcend (the only way to aſcend) and like that Raven at <hi>Rome,</hi> which flying over the Market-place when a great ſhout was given, fell down amongſt the People, he condeſcended, and very formally to ſalute all the Rout; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming on the ſudden ſo gracious, ſo debonair, ſo obliging a Prince, that they forgot all their former Exceptions; their diſcontent vaniſhing in an inſtant, like a Fogg upon the Suns Riſing, diſpell'd by the rayes of the preſent Grace he did them.</p>
               <p>And now being King, who would not but have him ſo: It was high time (as the Vulgar Proverb hath it) to put the Children to bed, and lay the Gooſe to the fire: For after having ſeen them thus undreſt and ſtrip'd naked, there remains no more but to draw the Curtains, and leave them to their reſt, like Lambs in the Lions Den, who could not ſleep at all, till he was aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd they had ſlept their laſt. For which black purpoſe he call'd a bloody Villain out of his Bed to ſmother them in theirs, who perform'd that hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid deed of Darkneſs with ſo much ſecreſie, that the truth of his falſhood could not be detected, till within theſe very few weeks, when ſome occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally digging in the <hi>Tower,</hi> at the place where it ſeems that poor Prieſt buried them, who afterwards dyed for his Piety, they found the Coffin, and in it the Bones of both the Princes, as well his whom <hi>Perkin Werbeck</hi> perſonated, as the King his Brother; which (I take it) are yet to be ſeen, or were very lately, in the Cuſtody of Sir <hi>Thomas Chicheley</hi> the Maſter of the Ordnance, to whom his Majeſty has intruſted the making a fitting Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for them in the Abbey of <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi>

               <p>Yet after all this great care of his to ſecure his Greatneſs, he run a risk of loſing it the very ſame way he got it; his antipathy to the Houſe of <hi>York</hi> being ſuch (for though he were but of the half blood of <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> he retain'd their whole hatred) even after the conſummation of his Nuptials, that the other Faction perceiving his Marriage to be an act of Neceſſity rather then Choice, wherein his Nature ſtrove with his Intereſt, and his Ambition with his Affection, which ſhould juſtle the other out; they took that umbrage at his coldneſs, that doubting their own, they invaded his Security, countering his Greatneſs with ſomething that ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed the Common People, that not being well able to judge whom they ought to oppoſe (like thoſe at <hi>Barnet-Field</hi> that fatally miſtook the Earl of <hi>Oxford</hi>'s Stars for King <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth his Suns) they knew not whom to obey, blinding their Eyes by continual falſe Lights. Amongſt which there were no Apparitions terrified them more then thoſe Aiery Typhons, <hi>Lambert, Perkin,</hi> and <hi>Wilford;</hi> the two firſt of which adventur'd on ſuch Perſonations, as wanted only Belief, to have charm'd all his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces without further Inchantation, and would doubtleſs have unravel'd his felicity, had not the parts which were found in his Vertue, as well as thoſe in his Fortune, been ſuch, as were no leſs matchleſs then their Villany: But there are ſome, who conclude from their being ſo ſilently vanquiſh'd as they were, that all (except only thoſe two walking Ghoſts of <hi>Edward Plantaginet</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York</hi>) were Spirits of his own raiſing, and nouriſh'd by himſelf, becauſe he would have the more reaſon not to reign in the Right of his Wife, the Glory of whoſe Houſe he purpoſed to extinguiſh as they do Torches, which being held downward, are put out by the ſuperfluity of their own matter. But this, as all other his great Acts of State, is rather gueſt at then underſtood, as it was his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it ſhould; giving therefore (and not improperly) the <hi>Percullis,</hi> the Emblem of Faſtneſs for his Device, to forbid all approaches to his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, no leſs then to his Power; it being natural to him to keep himſelf at ſuch a diſtance, and his Heart (as that of Kings ought to be) ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrutable, that he might render himſelf thereby more awful to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors at home, and more revear'd of his Confederates abroad: to whom he appear'd like one with a dark Lanthorn, keeping them alwayes in the Light, towards him, whilſt he himſelf was not perceiv'd by them. In which great point of Glory the great King of <hi>France</hi> would have been his Corri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, but notwithſtanding he was the wiſe Son of a wiſer Father, and had had as many Tutors in the Art of Government (that is of Diſſimulation) as any Prince whatever, yet he fell ſhort of him, and was therefore forc'd to be ſtill on the Deſenſive ſide, both he, and the King of <hi>Scots</hi> his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league, being like two great <hi>Iriſh</hi> Greyhounds worried by an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiff, which fighting by ſnaps, run as ſoon as they could get looſe of him. To ſay truth, he not only brought the War they raiſed upon him home to their own Doors, but brought them to attend at his, departing content with ſuch Conditions as he would put upon them: and however they both ſeem'd to have had the better of him, the firſt by getting away his Miſtreſs; the laſt by getting his Daughter; yet it appears that he gain'd the point from them, which was to him moſt important, and which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he valued above all things elſe, a Peace with Money. That Match of the King of <hi>France</hi> with the Heir of <hi>Britain,</hi> may rather be ſaid to be a wrong to <hi>Maximilian</hi> King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which had been eſpouſed to her before, then any aſſront to him afterward; notwithſtanding he had that Sentiment of the baffle, that he would not be pacifi'd, till the King
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:51478:153"/> of <hi>France</hi> laid him down Seven thouſand four hundred and fifty Ducats in preſent to defray the Charge he had been at in vindicating his Honour, and Two thouſand five hundred Crowns yearly, as a price for his Amity, which being duly paid all his Reign, and all the time of his Son after him, this did ſo far exceed any computation of Charge that could be pretended, that conſidering his Title to <hi>France,</hi> was by particular Agreement re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to him, at the ſame time, we may rather call it (as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> did then) <hi>a Tribute,</hi> then (as the <hi>French</hi> did) <hi>a Penſion,</hi> ſince being alwayes demanded as a <hi>Tribute,</hi> it was never deny'd for the Names ſake.</p>

And to ſay truth, he gave him ſuch a Jewel for it, as (her Birth, Beauty, and Parts conſidered) 'twas not in the World beſides, <hi>viz.</hi> the Princeſs <hi>Margaret</hi> his eldeſt Daughter: but herein he dealt like a wiſe Purchaſor, who was reſolv'd not to let go an Eſtate that lay ſo near and convenient to his own, for want of a little out-bidding the ordinary rate, foreſeeing (as he told his Councel at the match-making) that the leſſer Kingdom, if ever it came to be united to the greater, as in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity it would (unleſs, which was a bleſſing ſcarce to be hoped for, that the Iſſue of his own Body ſhould never fail) muſt inſenſibly be reduced without a Conqueſt (as ſince we have ſeen it hath been) if not under the ſame Laws, yet under the ſame Allegiance; which, he ſaid, would be a tye ſufficient to bind them to the obſervation of the ſame Intereſt, without the ſame advantage by it, and to bring them, who never could be ſubdued by Arms, though often overcome, to ſubmit willingly to the good pleaſure of Providence, when they ſhould find themſelves (like Ivy that grows up by ſome great Oak) rais'd up to a height they could never have attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to by themſelves, and partaking the benefit of our ſtrength, with the comfort of our heat, without contributing any thing to our Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The only Enemy indeed that ever match'd this great King, was one of the Feminine Gender, if ſo be we may not rather call her his Superiour then Equal, as having the Malice of a Woman joyn'd to the Spirit of a Man, and both elevated by the greatneſs of her Fortune, no leſs then of her Force. This was the Lady <hi>Margaret,</hi> ſecond Wife to that famous <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Hardy,</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and ſecond Siſter to King <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, who was ſo ſurcharg'd with Envy to the Houſe of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> that ſhe even hated her own Neece, for conſenting to marry him: but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhe found the ſame averſion in him to the Houſe of <hi>York</hi> (who in all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, if he could have had the Heir of <hi>Britain,</hi> had contemn'd all the grave Conſiderations of the Union) and that it was predominant not only over his Wars and Councels, but took place even in his Chamber and Bed; ſo that however he had made her his Wife, he ſtill refuſed her to be his Queen, denying her the Rites of Majeſty by Coronation, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Queens uſually had, though ſhe had bore him a Son to be a pledge of her Faith and Affection to him: I ſay, when ſhe ſaw that Marriage, which makes all perſons equal, had ſubjected her Neece to this inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, the indignation ſhe conceiv'd at it, did ſo rankle within her Breaſt, that ſhe never could have any reſt within her thoughts, as long as he had any within his Dominions: and therefore ſhe made it the whole labour of her thoughts to contrive all the wayes and means imaginable to dethrone him, becoming the avow'd Foſter-mother of almoſt all the Rebellions du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:51478:154"/> his Reign; conjuring up ſo many Spirits as could not poſſibly have been allay'd by the Magick of any Prince leſs wiſe or cautious then himſelf; who not only countermin'd all her Plots, but happily beat her at her own Weapon, by placing ſo many Flies and Familiars about her, that by frequent varying of their ſhapes and diſguiſes, rigled themſelves into the knowledge of all her Secrets, and by turning picklocks to ſo many of her Plots, to the overthrow of all thoſe that were ingaged in the Conſpiracy with her, that at laſt the very Fame and ſuſpicion of them prevented all her deſigns, no man daring to adventure himſelf, for fear of being blown up by he knew not whom, whiles he himſelf continued ſtill and quiet (like thoſe that catch Moles) till he ſaw the manner of their working, and then he took them without ſtriking a ſtroke, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming ſo eaſily as well as ſo wiſely, that <hi>Caeſars VENI, VIDI, VICI,</hi> was not more terrible nor ſudden in its execution then his. And herein he was more particularly like that great Emperour, in that he ſtill oppos'd his own Perſon to all thoſe dangers which were viſible (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Domeſtick) which however ſome (taking from the Reputation of his Fortitude to add to that of his Wiſdome) aſcribe not to his natural forwardneſs, ſo much as to the diſtruſt he had of his Lieutenants; yet by how much it rendred him victorious, we ought to underſtand it in the beſt ſenſe, and believe him very bold, if not very valiant, in that he choſe rather to ſee then to hear of danger. In fine, look what deſcription an <hi>Athenian</hi> once gave of God, may be given of him that was his Lieutenant, That he was neither Bowman nor Horſman, Pikeman nor Footman, but one that knew well how to command all theſe, perhaps no man bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>Neither was he leſs fortunate then forward in Peace, as well as in War. So that as upon the one ſide he look'd like <hi>Caeſar,</hi> or <hi>Auguſtus</hi> rather, both of whom as they were armed with Lightning, ſo their Pardons went ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after their Swords: ſo on the other ſide he was not unlike thoſe two famous Legiſlators, <hi>Solon</hi> and <hi>Licurgus,</hi> who principally regarding the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, were yet ſo wiſe for themſelves, as with the publick ſafety to ſecure their own Authority: for he was an excellent Judge of times and ſeaſons, and knew when to ſtrain up the Laws to his Prerogative, and when to let down his Prerogative to the Teſt of the Law. And though 'twas obſerv'd never any man lov'd his own way nor his own will better then he, nor perhaps ever had ſo much Reaſon to do it, being as another <hi>Solomon,</hi> wiſer then his Counſellors (and yet they perhaps as well choſe as ever any Kings Counſellors were) yet we find he was ſometimes content to part with both, for the more orderly adminiſtration of Juſtice, leaving the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Mint, his Wars, and his Martial Juſtice (things of abſolute power) not to ſay the Concerns of his unſetled Title, which was yet of higher and tenderer conſideration, to the wiſdom of his Parliaments.

Now if his Enemies had ſuch dread of him, what eſteem muſt we imagine the Pope had, who owed his Deliverance to him. Silver and Gold he had none to tender, but ſuch as he had, Glorious and Grateful Titles he was very prodigal of: For beſides that of <hi>Liberator Urbis, &amp; Orbis</hi> (the Stile of his Anceſtor <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, and therefore though only fit for <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the Great) it being occaſional and temporary; the Conclave had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſideration ſuch as might be perpetuated to all Ages. Some mov'd to have him call'd <hi>Defenſor Romanae Eccleſiae:</hi> others propos'd <hi>Protector Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis Apoſtolicae:</hi> others again lik'd better to have him ſtil'd <hi>Rex Apoſtolicus,</hi> as ſome <hi>Rex Orthodoxus:</hi> but at laſt all agreed in that of <hi>Defenſor Fidei.</hi> After this he was made Head of the <hi>Holy League,</hi> out of belief <hi>That there could no Authority Superior to his, be interpos'd either for the Conſervation of good men in Peace, or repreſſing thoſe that are ill by War</hi> (for ſo are the words of the Fourteenth Article of the League.) This ſhews that he was ſo much greater then any of the Kings were before him, by how much they only gave Laws at home, but he throughout all Chriſtendom, diſpoſing War and Peace as made moſt to the advantage of his own People, who were thereupon ſo well ſatisfied with the Conduct of his Government, that his Will ſeems to have been the Supream Law. For as he needed to have ſaid no more to his Parliaments, then as one of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors (cited by <hi>Suetonius</hi>) was uſed to ſay to the Senate, <hi>Scitis quid velim &amp; quibus Opus habeo:</hi> So they could ſay no more to him, nor indeed any Parliament to any King, then was declar'd by their giving up themſelves and their Liberties wholly to him, in that Act of higheſt Truſt and Confidence, that ever Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects paſs'd, when they conſented that he ſhould (in caſe he had no Iſſue of his own) diſpoſe the Imperial Diadem of this Realm as his Highneſs pleas'd, by Will or Patent.</p>
               <p>Thus great was this King whiles he continued to be himſelf, keeping the Rains of Government in his own hands: but after he ſuffer'd himſelf to be govern'd by others (who took advantage of his to ſerve their own Luſts) like one drawn from his Center, his motions were ſo irregular, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treagues of State ſo perplext, that we cannot wonder at thoſe Diſorders which followed, to the great interruption of his Peoples peace and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, but much more of his own, whilſt that which private men eſteem their greateſt happineſs, fell out to be his greateſt curſe, the enjoyment of a moſt vertuous, diſcreet, and loving Wiſe; who being a Lady of that quick-ſight, that ſhe look'd thorough all his great Miniſters Ambitions, and occaſionally detected their Deſigns, was undone by the ſame way ſhe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to preſerve her ſelf and him. For the jealous Cardinal <hi>Wolſey,</hi> his great Miniſter, doubting that ſhe might interpoſe her ſelf betwixt the King and him, as the Moon betwixt the Sun and the Earth, and thereby deprive him of thoſe warm influences of Grace from whence his power took life, he deſign'd to blaſt her as it were by Lightning from Heaven, or rather by a Spark from Hell, caſting a Scruple into the Kings Conſcience, which quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet it on fire, upon the apprehenſion of being guilty of the inceſtuous Sin of knowing his Brothers Wife. This was ſo craftily managed, that it was not known for a while out of what Quiver the Arrow came: but a Treaty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had about a Marriage of the King of <hi>France</hi> with the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> the Kings Daughter by her, it was ſo order'd that the Biſhop of <hi>Tarbe</hi> (the principal Commiſſioner on that ſide) ſhould make ſome doubt of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimacy of the Princeſs, thereby to bring on the Queſtion of Inceſt. This though it was urged with ſomewhat more then uſual vehemency, yet his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:51478:156"/> not being ſuch as to move the King much at that time. The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſecretly ingaged the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> his Majeſties Confeſſor, to preſs him farther upon it, knowing well (as he acknowledged afterward) that whatever was once put into the Kings head, would hardly ever be got out again; nothing doubting withal, but that it was in his power at any time to conjure the Devil down again as ſoon as he had done his Service; and after be had tumbled the Queen down (or at leaſt) brought her into a neceſſity of making uſe of his Friendſhip, wherein he had two great ends.

Now whether it were that the King doubted his power, and thought he could not make good what he promiſed, for that he could not make that Marriage out, which he had already, to be either lawful or unlawful, ſo as to relieve him or diſmiſs it: Or whether he had (as is more probable) a clear Sentiment of the Popes ſlight Opinion of him, in making ſo unuſual, not to ſay unlawful a Propoſal to him, is not certain; but certain it is, he never forgave the Affront, till by vertue of his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per power he had divorced himſelf from his Authority: which the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal labouring to uphold by his Legatine power, out of hope of being himſelf Pope, nor only loſt himſelf in the attempt, but drew all he Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy who took part with him into a Premunire: Of whoſe Error his wiſe Servant <hi>Cromwel</hi> took the advantage, making his Maſters fall the occaſion of his own riſing, by whom the thoroughly humbled Convocation we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But long it was not ere the unexpected cauſe of that Innocent Queens ſufferings was made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by the unexpected Labour of Queen <hi>Jane</hi> her Succeſſor, who made ſo good ſpeed to bring the King a Son and Heir (which was the thing he deſired above all things in the World) that being married on the Twentieth of <hi>May</hi> ſhe fell in Labour the Twelfth of <hi>October</hi> following. But Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that had decreed ſhe ſhould only Conceive, but not bring forth, to ſignalize the Revenge of Queen <hi>Anne</hi>'s Death, by that of hers, put it into the Kings heart to turn himſelf Man-Midwife, rather then loſe the hopes of a Kingdom; who accordingly commanded the Child to be rip'd untimely out of her Womb: an act of great horrour, and ſo much more unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perform'd, for that he was unprovided of another Wife for the preſent. In this Condition Biſhop <hi>Gardner</hi> found him at his Return out of <hi>Germany,</hi> who putting him out of all hopes of any Cloſure with the Proteſtant Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, unleſs he would come under the Standard of their Faith, and allow of the <hi>Auguſtan Confeſſion;</hi> eaſily perſwaded him to purge himſelf of the ſcandal of Hereſie, by ſhewing the World he had only ſhook off the Pope, but not the Religion. Here the Scene chang'd again, and the firſt thing appear'd was that bloody Statute containing the Six Articles, which being diſcharg'd as a Murthering Piece amongſt the new Reformiſts, cut off moſt of thoſe who ſtood in its way: the Report whereof was ſo loud and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the two great Prelates, <hi>Latimer</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and <hi>Shax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> were frightned out of their Biſhopricks; who not being willing to have any hand in the approbation or execution of them, ſuffer'd as patiently under his Title of <hi>Defender of the Faith,</hi> as the Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> had before under that of his <hi>Supremacy.</hi> And now Conſcience being revolted from its ancient way of reſolving Doubts, to an abrupt Deciſion of the Common Law, that did not inſtruct but force the Offender<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="295" facs="tcp:51478:158"/> ſuffer death under his Reign, as how ſo many ſurviv'd it; all Papiſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in danger to be hang'd, and all Anti-papiſts to be burn'd. Yet in this great Storm <hi>Cromwell</hi> behav'd himſelf like a wiſe Pilot, who finding he could not prevent the running of the Veſſel in a contrary Courſe to his mind, thought it enough that he kept it from being quite over-ſet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly with great dexterity he brought on the Treaty once more with the Confederate Princes, who were it ſeems alarum'd by the Counter-League which the Roman Catholicks ſet up under the Title of <hi>The Holy League;</hi> the conſequences of which being juſtly to be ſuſpected, he made uſe of their preſent apprehenſions to renew the Treaty, and by his contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance there came a Letter to the King from <hi>Melancthon</hi> (to whom the King ſeem'd alwayes to have great regard) exhorting him to perfect the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation begun, as well in the Doctrinal as the Ceremonial part of Worſhip. To which the King, by advice of <hi>Gardiner,</hi> gave this Anſwer, <hi>That he would make a League with them in honeſt Cauſes, as he had done with the Duke of</hi> Juliers, <hi>and after that he would treat of an Accord in Religion.</hi> This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no way ſatisfactory to them, much leſs to <hi>Cromwell,</hi> who had ſlatter'd them with hopes of a better Accommodation, he caſt about another way to compaſs his end, and knowing very well that the King did alwayes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer his Pleaſure before his Revenge (as thoſe that mean to take great Fiſhes bait their Hooks with fleſh) ſo he held up the Treaty with the Propoſal of a new Match, that he believ'd could not but be very acceptable, not only in reſpect of the Kings having been near three Years a Widower, but for that it was ſuch as (he ſaid) would at once anger and curb the Emperor, the Popes only Executioner, to make good his late Fulmination: This was a Daughter to the Duke of <hi>Cleve,</hi> who being a Proteſtant, and Father in Law to the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and next Neighbour to the Emperors Dominions in the Low Countries: there ſeem'd to be in the Propoſal great conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of State, beſides that of Riches and Beauty; the laſt being the firſt thing in the Kings Thoughts, wherein <hi>Hans Holbin</hi> the famous Painter contributed much to the deceiving him, which whether it prov'd more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate to her, or <hi>Cromwell,</hi> I cannot ſay: but it ſo fell out, that the King diſguſting her after he ſaw her, was eaſily prevail'd with to repudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate her, and conſequently to reject the Match-maker, who having it in his Fate to be undone (as he was at firſt ſet up) by the Smock, was ſacrificed to the Envy of the People rather then his Maſters Diſpleaſure, who let them lay the load of his Faults upon him, and being a Prince that drew upon all his great Miniſters more blame then either they could bear, or durſt anſwer, he left him to periſh under the weight of it. And which made his Caſe more deplorable perhaps then that of moſt others that felt the weight of his Iron Rod, and therefore look'd more like a Judgment from Heaven then Earth, was, Firſt, that he ſuffer'd him to be condemn'd, at the ſame time all other men, by a general and free pardon, were indempni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied from the ſame Crimes, of which he ſtood accus'd. Secondly, in that he died like <hi>Phalaris,</hi> by an Inſtrument (as ſome ſay) of his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting. Thirdly and laſtly, that after having been Vicegerent to the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender of the Faith,</hi> he ſhould dye as an <hi>Heretick</hi> for oppoſing the Faith, after having had the repute of a faithful Servant, indeed ſo faithful, that (as <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s Letter to the King, yet to be ſeen, teſtifies) he cared not whom he diſpleas'd to ſerve his Majeſty, he ſhould dye like one that had merited no favour from him. That he who was ſo vigilant to detect all Treaſons in their Embrio, ſhould dye like a Traytor himſelf. That he that had no bounds ſet to his Authority, ſhould dye for exceeding his Commiſſion.
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:51478:159"/> Laſtly, That he who was the only <hi>Maſter of Requeſts,</hi> and gave an anſwer to all men that made any Addreſſes to the King, ſhould himſelf dye unheard as well as unpitied. But when we conſider all this, we muſt conclude the end of ſome mens Riſe is to keep others from Falling; Providence oftentimes upholding Juſtice even by Injuſtice, that ſo by correcting ſome men cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly, ſhe may certainly teach all men Caution.</p>
               <p>The King having thus rid himſelf of his new Wife, and his old Servant, both ſubmitting to his Will; the firſt with the loſs of her Eſtate and Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (for inſtead of being his Queen, ſhe was adopted his Siſter) the laſt with the loſs of both his Eſtate and Life; he found the means to repair the want of the one (though he could not of the other) by taking to his Bed (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps with no diſparity to his Greatneſs, if there had been none betwixt her own Vertue and Beauty) the fair Lady <hi>Katherine Howard,</hi> Neece to the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> who ſeems to be born to be a Scourge of the Injuſtice ſhew'd to his former Wives, whilſt her Incontinence, under the veil of a clear and moſt modeſt behaviour appear'd ſo notorious, that being confeſſed by her ſelf, he himſelf was forc'd to ſuffer in the ſhame with her: which he was ſo ſenſible of, that we find by a Law <hi>ex poſt facto,</hi> he labour'd to prevent the like for the future. And now being as it were weary of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of that kind, this being his fifth Wife that was executed, or ſuffer'd worſe, his Love gave place once more to his Ambition, which he gratified with a new Title, or rather the Superfoetation of an old one, cauſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be ſtiled <hi>King of Ireland,</hi> whereas none of his Predeceſſors were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe ſtiled then <hi>Lords</hi> thereof: which, as it was in the firſt place in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by him as an additional honour to that Nation, rather then to himſelf, ſo in the laſt place he did it to prevent <hi>James</hi> the Fifth of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> who had an Invitation from ſome of the diſcontented Nobility there, to have taken it on him, having before affronted him by aſſuming the Title of <hi>Defender of the Faith,</hi> with the addition only of the word <hi>(Chriſtian)</hi> as if there were any other Faith but what was in truth ſo: and becauſe he was reſolv'd to quarrel him upon it, he ſent to require Homage to be paid him for that Kingdom, urging that the Kings of that Nation had for many Ages ſubmitted themſelves in a qualified Condition of Vaſſalage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Kings his Anceſtors, both before and ſince the Conqueſt.</p>
               <p>This begat a War which ended not with the Life of that King, being ſtruck to the heart with the melancholy apprehenſions of being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>match'd: who dying, left a young Daughter to ſucceed, whom King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> thought a fitting Wife for his Son Prince <hi>Edward;</hi> and accordingly after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, in deſpight of all the tricks of the <hi>French</hi> Party, that then rul'd there, he brought it to ſuch a Treaty, as amounted to a Contract, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Hands and Seals of both ſides. But the <hi>Scots</hi> ſhewing themſelves by their wonted breach of Faith, to be true <hi>Scots,</hi> all ended in War, wherein though he were victorious, yet the main buſineſs was nothing advanc'd by the Succeſs, there being more done then became a Suiter for Alliance, and too little for one pretending to Conqueſt. Hereupon he was forc'd to try the Fortune of another Treaty with the diſcontented Earl of <hi>Lenox,</hi> who having formerly been ſet up by the <hi>French,</hi> to be Governour of the young Queen and the Kingdom, but deſerted by them when he had moſt need of their aid, he was thought the fitteſt Perſon to be tampered with for regain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Point, or at leaſt to keep all quiet there: whilſt the King, aſſiſted by the Emperour, with whom he had newly entred into a ſtrict League, ſought more conſiderable Glory in the Invaſion of <hi>France,</hi> whither he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to go again in Perſon: where, notwithſtanding that King out of dread
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:51478:159"/> of his power, had ſummon'd all his Feiſes, and brought together his Arrereban (as they call them) to oppoſe him; he took the Town of <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loigne,</hi> and had undoubtedly inlarged his Conqueſts to the very Walls of <hi>Paris,</hi> had not the Emperour privately patch'd up a Peace without him. Upon notice whereof he thought fit to return home to reinforce the War in <hi>Scotland:</hi> where, though he did not much, yet 'twas more perhaps then was expected at that time. For notwithſtanding their conjunction with the <hi>French,</hi> who entred upon one ſide, whiles they preſt in on the other, both ſetting upon him, like two Maſtiffs upon a Lion, yet he only rowſing himſelf, ſhook them off again, and purſuing them home to their own doors, did them ſo much more miſchief then they were able to do to him, that they call'd for quarter, chooſing rather to treat then fight: upon which there enſued a Peace, the Conditions whereof whoe're examines, will find that he knew how to yield, as well as how to conquer, giving them the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of having back their good Town of <hi>Bulloigne,</hi> but they were to pay him for it Eight hundred thouſand Crowns, and the poſſeſſion was to be his till the laſt payment were made.</p>
               <p>And now having as it were tired himſelf with Victory, it was time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire into the conſideration of taking his eternal reſt, having ſeen many of his brave men go before him; as the valiant Lord <hi>Poynings,</hi> the Hardy Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> his conſtant Favorite, the Noble Lord <hi>Ferrers</hi> of <hi>Chartley,</hi> the brave Lord <hi>Grey, &amp;c.</hi> And it being now the Eight and thirtieth year of his Reign, and the Six and fiftieth of his Age, labouring under an unuſual heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Body, and perhaps a greater of Mind, having made Peace with all Enemies, but the <hi>Scots</hi> and Pope, having diſ-joynted the Frame of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and drove away moſt of thoſe that ſhould put it in frame again, having by the Severity of his Juſtice taken off two Queens, two Cardinals (for <hi>Pool</hi> ſtood condemn'd, though not apprehended) three Dukes, Marquiſſes, Earls, and Earls Sons twelve, Barons and Knights eighteen, which could not but irritate much the Temporal Nobility; and of Biſhops, Abbots, Priors, Monks, Prieſts (which as much incenſt the Clergy) no leſs then Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty ſeven, having offended his Roman Catholick Subjects, by diſowning the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and his Proteſtant Subjects, by rejecting the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; he was brought at laſt to that unhappy period, to leave the Crown to a Child, whoſe condition was like to prove as uncertain, under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of a Protector, as the Kingdom under his; which in caſe of want of Iſſue of his Body, was to deſcend to his two Siſters ſucceſſively; of whoſe Legitimacy, Religion, and Title, there were as many ſcruples before they parted from the Soveraignty, as ever their Father conceiv'd in point of State, Conſcience, or Honour, before he parted from their Mothers. So from the Cataſtrophe of his whole Story we may bring this remark, That as no man could meaſure his Happineſs by his Greatneſs, ſo neither can they take any ſcantling of his Greatneſs by any thing that the World calls Happineſs: it being very true which the Marquiſs of <hi>Dorſet</hi> told him very plainly, and not unpleaſantly, at a time when he was ill diſpos'd to hear a Jeſt, and not well prepared to be ſerious, to wit, <hi>That no man could be truly mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that had above one Wife in his Bed, one Friend in his Boſom, and one Faith in his Heart.</hi>

               <p>Now whether his Lady, that had been the Wife of a King before, did (while ſhe was alive) put him upon any hopes of being ſo now (for am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Men, like ſeal'd Doves, mount the higher for being blinded) is not certain; but certain it is, that as ſoon as ſhe died (which was not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) he reſum'd the confidence to approach ſo near the Throne, as to Court the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the ſecond time, now grown a little riper for conſent,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:51478:161"/> then when he firſt mov'd the Queſtion to her. Neither was it carried ſo ſecretly, but that his Brother had an inſight into the whole practice, and at laſt diſcover'd the whole Plot; but conceal'd his knowledge of it, either out of pity or prudence, as loath to ruin him with the hazard of loſing himſelf; or as doubting perhaps that the Sword of Juſtice was not long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to reach him, at leaſt not ſharp enough to cut thorough the knot of the whole Conſpiracy. But as Fate never fails undoing the man ſhe has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd to deſtroy, and when ſhe falls upon him, makes the firſt ſtroke at his head: ſo happen'd it in this unhappy Lords caſe, who being unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctedly undermin'd, was blown up by a Train that ſeems to have taken fire as it were by Lightning from Heaven, his Treaſon being firſt detected out of the Pulpit; and the Protector his Brother ſo preſt, by an eloquent Sermon of Biſhop <hi>Latimer,</hi> to Impeach him, that he being not able to clear him, was in ſome ſence obliged to clear himſelf by a Speech which prov'd as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous as it was obvious, ſaying at the ſame time he caus'd him to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, <hi>That he would do and ſuffer Juſtice.</hi> And ſo he did, when he ſign'd the Warrant for his Execution (after the Parliament found him Guilty) with his own Hand. A ſingular piece of Self-denial, and ſuch as is rarely found in Story (there being very few that ſo much prefer the publick before their own private Intereſt, as not to ſpare their own fleſh and blood.) However, looking ſo like Revenge, it was by moſt men judg'd unnatural, and taking no leſs from the honour of his Juſtice, then t'other intended to have taken from the Prerogative of his Honour, ſo ſhuck the frame of his Authority, that it broke in pieces preſently after; and both Factions of Papiſts and Proteſtants falling off from him, he was expos'd to the cunning of <hi>Warwick,</hi> and the ſcorn of the Marquiſs of <hi>Dorſet,</hi> his moſt unreconcileable Enemies. The Papiſts quit him as believing the Obligation ceas'd by which, when he ceas'd by whom they were held in, having been true to him no otherwiſe, but for his Brothers ſake only. The Proteſtants fail'd him, becauſe they doubted he might fail them: for how could they think he would give them any Aſſiſtance, that had given to his own Brother ſo little. Thus when two great Trees grow up together out of one and the ſame Stock, we ſee that the cutting down of the one commonly indangers the blowing down of the other; which remaining ſingle and expos'd to every ſtorm, cannot ſtand unleſs it have a firm ground, as well as a ſpreading Root. Neither was it long that the Protector bore up after his Brothers Fall: the great care he took to build his<note n="*" place="margin">From his Tittle call'd <hi>Somerſet-houſe</hi>
                  </note> Houſe, being no leſs fatal to him, then the little care he had to ſupport his Family, whiles the Stones of thoſe Churches, Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels, and other Religious Houſes that he demoliſh'd for it, made the cry out of the Walls ſo loud, that himſelf was not able to indure the noiſe; the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ecchoing to the defamation, and charging him with the guilt of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſo furiouſly, that he was forced to quit the place, and retire with the King to <hi>Windſor,</hi> leaving his Enemies in poſſeſſion of the ſtrength of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as well as the affections of the Citizens, who by the reputation of their power, rather then the power of their repute, prevail'd with the King as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily to give him up to publick Juſtice, as he was before prevail'd with to give up his Brother: it being no ſmall temptation to the young King to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake him, when he forſook himſelf ſo far, as to ſubmit to the acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Guilt he was not conſcious of. The Lawyers charged him with removing <hi>Weſtminſter-hall</hi> to <hi>Somerſet-houſe.</hi> The Souldiers with detaining their Pay, and betraying their Garriſons. The States-men with ingroſſing all Power, and indeavouring to alter the Fundamental Laws, and the ancient Religion. But he himſelf charg'd himſelf with all theſe Crimes,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:51478:161"/> when he humbled himſelf ſo far, as to ask the Kings pardon publickly, which his Adverſaries were content he ſhould have, having firſt ſtrip'd him of his Protectorſhip, Treaſurerſhip, Marſhalſhip, and Two thouſand pound a year Land of Inheritance. But that which made his Fate yet harder was, that after having acquitted himſelf from all Treaſon againſt his Prince, he ſhould come at laſt to be condemn'd as a Traytor againſt his Fellow-Subject, whilſt the Innocent King labouring to preſerve him, became the principal Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Deſtruction: who by reconciling him to his great Adverſaries, made the Enmity ſo much the more incompatible; who at the ſame time he gave the Duke his Liberty, gave the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> and his Friends the Complement of ſome new Titles, which adding to their Greatneſs, he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably judg'd might take from their Envy. The Earl himſelf he created Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and Lord High Admiral of <hi>England;</hi> and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige him yet more, married up his eldeſt Son the Lord <hi>Dudley,</hi> to his own Coſin, the ſecond Daughter of the Duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> whom he gave to him for the more honour with his own hand: and made Sir <hi>Robert Dudley,</hi> his fourth and his beloved Son (the ſame that was after made by Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi>) one of the Gentlemen of his Bedchamber. And to gratifie the whole Faction, he made the Marquiſs of <hi>Dorſet,</hi> Duke of <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk,</hi> the Lord <hi>St. John,</hi> Earl of <hi>Wilts,</hi> and afterwards Marquiſs of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> Sir <hi>John Ruſſel,</hi> who was <hi>Northamberland</hi>'s Confident, he created Earl of <hi>Bedford,</hi> Sir <hi>William Paget,</hi> another of his Tools, he made Lord <hi>Paget.</hi> This the good natur'd King did out of ſincere Affection to his Uncle, in hopes to reconcile him ſo thoroughly to <hi>Northumberland,</hi> ſo that there might be no more room left for Envy or Suſpect betwixt them. But as there is an invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible <hi>Erinnis</hi> that attends all Great men, to do the drudgery of their Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in ſerving their Revenge, and obſerving the Dictates of their power and pride; ſo it was demonſtrable by the moſt unfortunate iſſue of this ſo well intended purpoſe, that by the ſame way the King hoped to pleaſe both he pleas'd neither: <hi>Somerſet</hi> thinking he had done too much; <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland</hi> thinking that he had done too little; who having drunk ſo deep a Draught of Honour, grew hot and dry, and like one fall'n into a State-Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, ſwell'd ſo faſt, that <hi>Somerſet</hi> perceiving the Feaver that was upon him, reſolv'd to let him blood with his own hand. And coming one day to his Chamber under the colour of a Viſit, privately arm'd, and well attended with Seconds, that waited him in an outward Chamber, found him naked in his Bed, and ſuppoſing he had him wholly in his power, began to expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late his wrongs with him, before he would give him the fatal ſtroke: whereby t'other perceiving his intent, and being arm'd with a Weapon that <hi>Somerſet</hi> had not a ready fence for, (an Eloquent Tongue) he acquitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo well, and ſtring'd upon him with ſo many indearing proteſtations, as kept the point of his Revenge down, till it was too late to make any Thruſt at him. Whereby <hi>Northumberland</hi> got an advantage he never hop'd for, to frame a ſecond Accuſation againſt him, ſo much more effectual then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, by how much he brought him under the forfeiture of Felony, as being guilty of imagining to kill a Privy Counſellor, for which he was the more worthily condemn'd to loſe his Head, in that he ſo unworthily loſt his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, at the very inſtant of time when he was to vindicate his too much abus'd Patience, thereby betraying thoſe of his Friends that came to ſecond him, into the ſcandal of a Crime, which (had it ſucceeded) would have paſs'd for a magnanimous piece of Juſtice, in cutting off one, whom how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he was content to ſpare, Providence it ſeems was not, reſerving him to die a more ignoble death, and by a worſe hand.</p>

               <p>The ſorrow for his ignominious fall, as it much affected the Conſumptive King his Nephew, who was now left as a Lamb in the keeping of the Wolf, the Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> having got as high in Power as Title, by ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Family of the <hi>Seymours;</hi> ſo his end, which was not long after, put an end to the Reformation, and made way for the <hi>Dudley</hi>'s to aſpire with incredible Ambition, and not without hope of ſetling the Succeſſion of the Crown in themſelves. For the Duke finding that the King languiſh'd under a Hectical Diſtemper, and having better aſſurance, then perhaps any one elſe could, from his Son that alwayes attended in his Bedchamber, that it was impoſſible for him to hold out long, for Reaſons beſt known to him, he caſt about how to introduce the far fetch'd Title of his other Son, who had married the Lady <hi>Jane Gray,</hi> eldeſt Daughter to the Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi> by the Lady <hi>Frances,</hi> one of the Daughters and Heirs of <hi>Charles Brandon,</hi> by his Wife <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>France,</hi> the ſecond Daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth.

There was a third alſo, but he thought it not worth the conſideration, being ſo far off, to wit, the Title of the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> from the Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> eldeſt Daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, which being in the <hi>French,</hi> ſeem'd to be of leſs weight then if it had been in the <hi>Scots,</hi> to neither of whom he believ'd the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would ever be brought to ſubmit: but all theſe Difficulties were quickly digeſted in his ambitious Thoughts. The firſt, which was the pretention of the Lady <hi>Jane</hi>'s Mother, he hop'd to ſet aſide, by introducing her as the next Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, and not as the next Heir, by right of Deſcent: and becauſe the Kings Siſters were before her in the Succeſſion, ſo that nothing could be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailable to ſet aſide their Right, but a plain Diſſeiſure, he made uſe of the Intereſt of the one, as a Wedge to drive out the other. And finding that the King their Brother, by the Equity of a Law made in his Fathers time, had the power to nominate who he thought fit to come after him; he made it his great buſineſs to work upon his weakneſs, and to perſwade him to ſet both aſide, and admit the Lady <hi>Jane;</hi> taking his firſt Argument from his Piety and Care of the Church, under the preſent eſtabliſhment made by himſelf: ſhewing him what danger 'twas like to be in, if ſo obſtinate a Papiſt as his Siſter <hi>Mary</hi> ſucceeded, who having been convict before all the Lords of the Councel, had moſt paſſionately juſtified her Popiſh Principles, ſaying, <hi>She would never change her Faith, much leſs diſſemble it:</hi> Urging thereupon that Gods Glory ought to be dearer to him then his own Fleſh and Blood, that this was his laſt and greateſt Act, of which he knew not how ſoon he might be call'd to give an Accompt to the King of Kings; and therefore deſired him for Gods ſake, as well as for the Kingdoms and his own ſake, not to let her take place. Then for the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> whom he could not deny to be a Proteſtant, he ſaid if ſhe ſhould be prefer'd before her elder Siſter, it might poſſibly give an occaſion to unconceivable Troubles, and
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:51478:162"/> revive the Diſputes about their Legitimacy, which had coſt too much blood already: beſides the hazard that would be of the Churches, no leſs then their own Peace, and the poſſibility of bringing the whole Nation under the Yoke of ſome ſtranger Prince, to whoſe Tyranny the People would never ſubmit; concluding, that as the three Daughters of the Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi> were neareſt in Blood, and being married, took off all fears of introducing Forreigners; ſo having with their Natural, ſuck'd in the <hi>Sincere Milk of the Word,</hi> they could not but maintain the Truth of the Reformed Religion, as well as the Dignity of the Succeſſion, with univerſal good liking. And whereas the eldeſt of them (to wit, the Lady <hi>Jane</hi> before mention'd) was his own Sons Wife, he could be content they ſhould both be bound by Oath to perform whatever his Majeſty ſhould Decree, for that he had no ſuch regard to his own as to the general good.

After doing of which weak act, having nothing more to do, but to dye, 'tis thought the Duke was ſo grateful, as to contribute much to the delivering him out of his pains, as ſoon as might be, and with as much eaſe: for he ſlept away with that meekneſs, that thoſe that could not find in their hearts to pray for him living, perform'd that Charity to him when he was dead. However, ſome there were who ſower'd with a Religious Leaven, took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to raiſe as great a ſcandal on the untimelineſs of his death, as others had before upon that of his Birth, putting this remark upon it, to make it look like a Judgment, that it was in the ſame Moneth, and in the very ſame day of the ſame Moneth that Sir <hi>Tho Moor</hi> was put to death by his Father. Wherein whilſt they maliciouſly reflected upon the Evil that was paſt, they conſider'd not how (like another <hi>Joſiah</hi>) he was taken from the Evil to come; departing with this Juſtification before Men and Angels, That he had done as much as could be reaſonably expected from the tenderneſs of his Years or his Power.</p>

               <p>And now it appear'd how ominous it was for the Innocent Lady <hi>Jane</hi> to have been brought as ſhe was in ſtate to the <hi>Tower.</hi> But as ſhe offer'd Violence to her own Inclinations, out of Obedience to thoſe of her Father and Mother, ſo the aſſumption of that temporary was in order to the inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuling her to a more laſting Glory; being taught the vanity of all humane Greatneſs by the brevity of that of her own, which laſted not ſo long as 'tis reported a Dream of one did but a little before; (for there is a Story of one <hi>Foxley,</hi> a Pot-maker to the Mint in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight's time, that ſlept fourteen dayes together, and no body could wake him, no not with pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or burning) whereas ſhe came to her ſelf in leſs then ten dayes, and then, poor Lady, found herſelf (where he was too) in the Tower ready to be tranſlated (as after ſhe was) from a Kingdom to a Scaffold, and from the Scaffold to a Kingdom again. Happy had it been for her if it had prov'd a Dream only: ſuffering not ſo much for any Crime of her own Ambition, as for not reſiſting that of others; having this aggravation of her affliction, to ſee her Husband and the Duke his Father executed before her, who both died for the ſame Fault, but not with the ſame Faith that ſhe did: The Duke that had therefore importun'd King <hi>Edward</hi> to give her this fatal honour, to the intent Popery might be utterly aboliſh'd, declaring when he came to ſuffer, that he himſelf was a Roman Catholick, which moſt think he: had not done, had not ſome Promiſes of Life upon condition of turning, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd him at the very inſtant time of his Death; whereby Queen <hi>Mary</hi> was quit with him at the laſt, though ſhe could not deal with him in the firſt place. For as he was reputed to have had no Faith whilſt he lived, ſo by this abrupt Apoſtacy he was judg'd to have no Religion when he dyed. There is this further Remark upon him, That as he ſuffer'd under the ſame Fate, and upon the very ſame Block, the late Duke of <hi>Somerſet</hi> did; ſo 'twas his hap to be laid under the ſame Stone, in the ſame Grave, where they now lye ſide by ſide as good Friends, that living were unreconcilable Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: Two headleſs Dukes, betwixt two headleſs Queens,<note place="margin">The Lady <hi>Anna Buloigne,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Katherine Howard.</hi>

               <p>Eight dayes and upwards paſt between the proclaiming of this Queen and the calling her firſt Parliament; during which time the two Religions were publickly permitted with equal Indulgence. The Divine Service being ſo blended with Superſtition, that (as one obſerves) the State of <hi>England</hi> before her Perſecution, was not much unlike that of the Jews af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theirs, who preſently upon the Captivity, took a mid way between <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Aſhdod:</hi> on the ſame day that Maſs was ſung in the Quire at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> the Engliſh Service was ſung in the Body of the Church. And the two Religions (if divided Opinions may deſerve that Name) being thus brought to confront each other, no marvel if the Demagogues of each Perſwaſion, juſtled for Precedence; the Proteſtants being back'd by the preſent Laws, the Papiſts by the Prerogative: theſe incouraged by the Queens Opinion, thoſe by her Promiſes. But as in the cloſe of Day, light and darkneſs conteſting for Superiority, ſeem equally match'd, till in the end the latter prevails: So happen'd it now upon the death of the late King, whoſe Religion being different to that of his Succeſſor, the Queſtion was which muſt take place, and become the Religion of the State: She her ſelf being not ſo forward to declare after ſhe came to be Queen, as ſhe was before. But to palliate the matter in diſcharge of her Obligations to the Loyal Proteſtant Gentry of <hi>Suffolk</hi> and <hi>Norfolk,</hi> that were the firſt ſet her up, ſhe ſeem'd content to call a Parliament, that might take off the <hi>Odium</hi> from her, making way to it by a general pardon, which had ſo many Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

But that which made it the more ſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was, that however ſhe was prodigal of her Subjects Lives, ſhe was yet more ſparing of their Livelyhoods: For ſhe began with a rare Example in pardoning the very firſt Subſidy ſhe had, and ſhe never had but one more. So that putting that which was remitted, againſt that which was received, ſhe had upon the matter none at all all her time. And yet we find ſhe was in continual Action at home or abroad, having alwayes (as her Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her) occaſion to make uſe of men at Arms, either to defend or inlarge her Dominions. For as ſhe was obſtinate in the Reſolution ſhe had taken of reſtoring the Popes Authority, contrary to the promiſe ſhe made to thoſe who firſt ſet her up; being perſwaded by the Prieſts that rul'd there, that ſhe had no ſuch way to manifeſt her Faith as by the breach of it: So ſhe cut out ſo much matter for Rebellion, by the Violence ſhe offer'd both to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and Intereſt, that ſhe had little Reſt, but no Peace all her dayes.</p>
               <p>Now whether it were a natural Diſtruſt of her weakneſs, as ſhe was a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or a Feminine Diffidence of her Wiſdom, as ſhe was a Maid, or that in truth ſhe deſir'd a help meet for ſatisfaction of her Affections, as well as for ſupport of her Affairs, is not otherwiſe to be judg'd, then by the choice ſhe made: But ſo it was, that finding ſhe could not ſtand by her ſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Husband, no more then an Adjective without a Subſtantive, ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd it as the firſt thing to her Councel, directing them to make choice of ſuch an one for her, as might be as fit to give Laws to her, as ſhe to them. Three there were in Propoſal for her; <hi>Philip</hi> Infant of <hi>Spain,</hi> Son to the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, the old Cardinal <hi>Pool,</hi> and the young Marquiſs of <hi>Exeter:</hi> to each of which, as there were ſome Motives to draw her Affections, ſo there were many Arguments to diſſwade her from them. Thoſe that had reſpect to the ſettlement of the Kingdom, thought <hi>Philip</hi> the fitteſt match, as being a Puiſſant King, ſtrengthned with many great Allies, and who had as great an Enmity to the <hi>French</hi> (the only Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my <hi>England</hi> ought to fear) as they themſelves. But againſt him the firſt Objection was, That he was a Stranger. The ſecond, That being Native of <hi>Spain,</hi> he probably might by this Match bring <hi>England</hi> into ſome danger of Subjection to that Kingdom. And laſtly, That there was ſomewhat of undecency, not to ſay inequality, in reſpect to his Perſon, for that it ſeem'd ſtrange that ſhe ſhould be the Wife of the Son now, who thirty years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould have been Wife to the Father. Thoſe that ſtood for the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal urg'd his Love to his Country, and the Love the Country had for him, in reſpect of his great Sanctimony and Wiſdom, which rendred him parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly acceptable to the Queen: then for his Dignity, he was not much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:51478:164"/> to Kings, and by his Mother deſcended from Kings; and for his Age, it was more agreeable to that of the Queens, then that of either of the other two. But the principal end of Marriage being Procreation, he fell under an exception not to be anſwer'd, as being a Batchelor of near Sixty four years old, and ſo needed a Nurſe rather then a Wife. The Youth of the Lord <hi>Courtney,</hi> being a brisk Cavalier, and by Birth, as well as the beſt Blood of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> could make him, gave him the prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence above the Cardinal. But ſome of the Juncto objecting, That he lov'd Popularity more then ever he could be brought to love the Queen, and that he ſmell'd too ranck of <hi>Lutheriſm</hi> to be her Bed-fellow, they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it by a general Vote againſt him, for King <hi>Philip:</hi> as well to take off all Exceptions by the Diſparagement of marrying a Subject, as for thoſe ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and moſt Incredible Advantages it brought to <hi>England,</hi> which were expreſs'd in the Inſtrument of Marriage yet extant, whereof there needs no further mention then the addition of the <hi>Netherlands</hi> and <hi>Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> to be for ever a Member of the Imperial Crown of this Realm, in caſe there had been any Iſſue betwixt them. All this notwithſtanding, ſuch was the unſettledneſs of the Times, or of mens Minds rather, whilſt ſome were led by Conſcience, others by their Temporal Concerns; ſome out of Love to Reformation, and others out of fear of Superſtition; ſome again out of deſire of Change, but moſt out of dread of Forreign Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude, that the Concluſion of this Match gave beginning to a deſperate Rebellion, which, though at firſt it ſeem'd deſpicable enough, being headed by no better a man then Sir <hi>Thomas Wyat,</hi> a private Knight of <hi>Kent</hi> (the Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> who was in the Conſpiracy, being appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended almoſt as ſoon as he appear'd) yet before it could be ſuppreſt, the wiſe Match-makers found they had met with their Match in that Rebel, who was ſo fortunate as to rout the Queens General, and take all their Ordnance and Ammunition. Upon which he march'd up with full Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of taking the chief City; into which though he brought but ſive Enſigns, 'tis probable he might have carried it, had not Heaven taken part againſt him (as uſually it doth againſt Rebels, firſt arming them with Impudence, and then diſarming them with Fear) making the Arch-Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor a terrible Example of unparallel'd Inſolence; who, whiles he was at large, continued bold as a Lion, but being once apprehended, prov'd ſo baſe a Coward, that brib'd with the hopes of Life, he made himſelf guilty of a greater Treachery then he was to dye for; accuſing <hi>Edward</hi> Earl of <hi>Devon,</hi> and the Princeſs <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the Queens Siſter, to have been privy to his Conſpiracy: which gain'd Credit not ſo much from the Suſpect of any private Affection betwixt them two (although he alleadged they were to be married) as from the ſecret diſaffection either of them had, he to the King that ſhould be, as being his Rival; ſhe to the Queen that was, as being her Diſſeiſor (the two Siſters as little agreeing in point of Right of Succeſſion, as their two Mothers in point of Right of Marriage) but fain he would have acquitted them, when he found he could not be acquitted himſelf by it; for having ſerv'd their turn of him, the Stateſmen gave the fatal turn to him. However, the malitious Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor <hi>Gardner,</hi> reſolving to take the Truth at the wrong end, and believe it as he pleas'd, ſecur'd them in ſeveral Priſons, till he were at leiſure to examine the matter; being then deeply ingaged in providing Fire and Faggots for thoſe Learned Hereticks, <hi>Cranmer, Ridley,</hi> and <hi>Latimer,</hi> &amp;c. who were to make a Holocauſt preparatory to the Queens Nuptials: which having been defer'd by this unexpected Riſing, was now propos'd
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:51478:165"/> in Parliament. For the greater confirmation, the three States of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom aſſenting thereto upon the Conditions following: <hi>Firſt, That King</hi> Philip <hi>ſhould admit no Stranger into any Office, but only Natives. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That he ſhould Innovate nothing in the Laws and Cuſtomes of the Realm. Thirdly, That he ſhould not carry the Queen out of the Realm without her conſent, nor any of her Children without conſent of the Councel. Fourthly, That ſurviving the Queen, he ſhould challenge no Right in the Kingdom, but ſuffer it to deſcend to the next Heir. Fifthly, That he ſhould carry away none of the Crown Jewels, nor remove any Shipping or Ordnance. Sixth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and laſtly, That he ſhould neither directly nor indirectly intangle the Realm of</hi> England <hi>with the Wars betwixt Spain and France.</hi> Upon which Terms 'twas hop'd by thoſe affected not the Match, that <hi>Philip</hi> would knock off, there being neither Youth or Beauty to tempt him. But as the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> did ever prefer their Ambition before their Love, ſo deſigning the univerſal Monarchy, he thought he made a great ſtep to it, by being put in poſſeſſion of <hi>England,</hi> and ſo near intituled to <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now the moſt Catholick King being joyn'd with the Faith defending Queen, it cannot be imagin'd, but that they muſt begin with Religion: In order to the Regulation whereof, Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi> (being firſt reſtored a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in blood and reputation) was ſent for over; who arm'd with his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatine Power, and a natural Force of Eloquence, preſs'd hard upon the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and ſhewed them the danger they were in, by their late Schiſm; being become (as he ſaid) Exiles from Heaven, and in no capacity to have been ever readmitted, had he not brought from <hi>Rome</hi> the Keys, that open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the gates of Life: and thereupon he adviſed them to abrogate thoſe Laws, which lay, as blocks, in their way, urging them thereto from the Example of their good King and Queen; who (he ſaid) had reſigned their Title of Supream Head, to ſhew themſelves true Members of the Myſtical Body, and had made Reſtitution of thoſe Lands, which had been ſacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly taken from the Church by their Predeceſſor. Which Speech of his being very Methodically digeſted, and delivered with great gravity, ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led many of the Lords, who reflected upon their Fore-fathers Devotion to the holy See: but thoſe of the lower Houſe, having it ſeems lower thoughts, and deeming it a rare Felicity, to have ſhaken off that heavy Yoke, that had ſo long gall'd their Fore-fathers necks, did not ſo readily aſſent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his profer'd Fenediction, at ſo dear a rate, as to part with their Lands, which having been divided by the Queens father amongſt them, were by ſeveral Settlements and Alienations, ſo tranſlated from one Family to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that, without great Inconvenience, they could not be ſever'd from their Temporal Proprieties. However, they ſo far complyed, as to agree. That the firſt Fruits and Tenths granted, by the Clergy, to King <hi>Henry, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> 1534, ſhould be remitted. But after they came to conſider the Poverty of the Treaſure, the reaſon of the ſeveral Penſions, that had been granted in Lieu thereof, by the ſaid King to divers Religious Perſons, that were ſtill living, they revok'd their Decree again. Upon which the Legate (not skilful enough to deal with a Multitude, as appear'd afterward by his loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the papal dignity) deſiſted; content it ſeems with the honour of having prevail'd over the more devout Queen, the heat of whoſe Zeal, had ſo ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her heart, that it was fit for any Impreſſion. Now as he had a better Faculty in Canvaſſing of the Feminine Sex (which Cardinal <hi>Carraffa</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Pope <hi>Paul</hi> IV<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upbraided him withal in the open Conclave) ſo he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd with her, to give up all that ſhe had in her own poſſeſſion; who to move others to imitate her piety did it, with that deteſtation of the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:51478:165"/> of her Predeceſſors, that when one of her wiſe Counſellors (yet of the ſame Religion) told her it would be a great Diminution to the Revenues of her Crown, ſhe anſwered piouſly, and, as ſhe thought prudently, that ſhe had another Crown to look after, that ſhe valued a thouſand times more then that.</p>
               <p>But while ſhe is thus careful for the eternal, King <hi>Philip,</hi> her Husband, was no leſs buſie to ſecure his Temporal Crown. In order to which, he went over to receive the Bleſſing of the Emperour, his Father, then in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;</hi> who upon his Arrival delivered up to him the poſſeſſion of the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> having given him the Kingdoms of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> before; of the firſt of which the Pope (either envying or fearing the Emperour's Greatneſs) had made the <hi>French</hi> King ſome Aſſurance, purpoſely to ingage him thereby in a War, that might weaken them both. Great Preparations were made by either Party, to ſecure themſelves both with Arms and Alliances; the Emperor leaving all his Dominions on this ſide to his Son, whilſt himſelf retires into <hi>Spain,</hi> to alarm the <hi>French</hi> on the other ſide; and by his Vicinity to <hi>Italy,</hi> whoſe petty Princes he ſuſpected not to be firm to his Intereſt, makes himſelf as terrible to his Neighbours as his Enemies. But whilſt this great deſign was in Proſpect only, King <hi>Philip</hi> was ſuddenly called home by a Brute, that his Queen was with Child; the Joy whereof was ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, that it is ſtrange to tell how much it tranſported the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; raiſing them by the hopes of a young Prince to a degree of ſeeming Infatuation: for they, not only, mock'd God Almighty in the Church, with cauſeleſs Thanksgivings, but troubled the King and Queen every hour in Court, with<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That which added to her Diſtemper was, an over-nice reſentment of the Popes diſpleaſure, who offended at her breach with the <hi>French,</hi> puniſh'd her (as Princes uſe to be by whipping their Favourites) with taking away the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatine Power from her beloved Miniſter Cardinal <hi>Pool;</hi> to whom, as ſhe had ever a great regard, ſo ſhe opin'd that the diſgrace put upon a Man of ſo great Authority and Credit, who had been ſo active in the Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Nation, would (as indeed it did) not only reflect ſomething on her honour, but hazard much the reputation of the Catholick Cauſe, whiles the Roman Religion was not ſo fully eſtabliſh'd as ſhe deſign'd it ſhould, and the Enemies of the Church no leſs dangerous to that of her State. This gave her great trouble of Mind; and that trouble being heightened by the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of her beloved Husband, brought her into a burning Feaver, that fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told a death that might have proved a living one, had it not been haſtned by the news of the revolt of <hi>Calais,</hi> which being loſt in leſs then ſix dayes time, after it had continued <hi>Engliſh</hi> above Two hundred years, came ſo near her heart, that drying up all her Blood, brought her under ſuch a fix'd ſadneſs, as left her not till ſhe left the World. Now to ſay truth, ſhe had great reaſon to reſent the loſs, for as it was the only Key left to let her into <hi>France,</hi> ſo it was no ſmall over-ſight to hang it by her ſide with ſo ſlender a String, as ſhe did, there being not above Five hundred Souldiers in it when it was attach'd, which were much too few to defend a place of that Importance, where there was a kind of neceſſity to keep the Gates alwayes open.</p>

<pb n="312" facs="tcp:51478:167"/> ſhew how little Confidence ſhe had in the ſtrength of her own Abilities, ſhe made it her firſt buſineſs to fortifie her ſelf with able Counſellors.

               <p>Neither was it a thing of ſmall Moment that came firſt to be weigh'd by her, to wit, the great Buſineſs of Religion: The Materials whereof being prepared to her hand by her Brother, as the Foundation was laid to his by her Father, ſhe reſolv'd to proceed in Edification of the Church, as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> did in building of the Temple, with as little noiſe as might be.

<pb n="313" facs="tcp:51478:167"/> to receive the Sacrament in both kinds. A well compounded Bait, and ſuch as if it had been large enough to have cover'd the Hook, might probably have taken any other Woman: but as her Conſcience forbid her to cloſe with the one, ſo Reaſon of State permitted not that ſhe ſhould come nearer the other then ſhe did. For there was newly ſtarted up a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Inlightned men, who took upon them to reform her Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and make it more Suitable (they would not ſay Conformable) to Chriſts Scepter and Kingdom, by rooting out thoſe Repreſentatives of Antichriſt, the Biſhops, who they thought to differ no otherwiſe from the Popiſh Prelates, then Rooks do from Ravens; deſiring inſtead of the Hierarchy, to ſet up a Goſpel Miniſtry (ſo they phras'd it) that was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Evangelicks, after the example of thoſe Congregational Paſtors of <hi>Geneva,</hi> who deſpiſing all Order, Habit, or Title, were underpropt or aſſiſted by two Lay-Elders choſen out of the graveſt, though not the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt of the People, whoſe Office (as one obſerves) like that of the Ears, is only to bear themſelves upright and hear what the <hi>Praetor</hi> ſays, without any other Eccleſiaſtical priviledge, pretence, or power. This projection was under-hand carried on by ſome ſquint-eyed Lawyers, who having one eye upon the Juriſdiction of the Biſhop, t'other upon her Prerogative, took all occaſions to detect the nakedneſs of her Government, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatter it with ſcurrilous Libels: Amongſt which there could be nothing more bold and Seditious then thoſe two notorious Books, the one intituled <hi>The Admonition to the Parliament;</hi> the other, <hi>The Defence of that Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> Not to mention thoſe lewd Pamphlets, call'd by the Names of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyn Marr Prelate; Chriſts Scepter and Kingdome; Englands Gulph, &amp;c.</hi> by the Oath <hi>Ex Officio</hi> was rendred Antichriſtian; and the Oath of Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy not lawful, but in a qualified ſenſe. This giving her ſufficient warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſecure the State by fortifying the Church, ſhe cauſed the Arch-biſhop <hi>Whitguift</hi> to caſt three Cannons, which were ſo plac'd, that Innovation could no way make its approaches to let in any of their Factious Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: For no man was to be admitted to the Cure of Souls that did not firſt recognize the Queens Supremacy: Secondly, ſubmit to the uſe of the Book of Common-Prayer and Ordination of Biſhops: and Thirdly, to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles paſs'd at the laſt Synod at <hi>London,</hi> 1562. and Laſtly, Declare that they believ'd either of them conſonant and agreeable to the word of God. However it was no ſmall Interruption that theſe brain-ſick men gave to her intended Reformation: and the Miſchiefs that attended it were ſo much more inſupportable, by how much they proceeded from a Religious Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that reign'd at that time over all Chriſtendome; moſt of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Nations, even as far as <hi>Italy</hi> it ſelf (not excepting the very Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the Pope) labouring under the ſame Diſtemper, which was a kind of Spiritual Feaver, that caus'd ſuch an Inflammation in their Conſciences, as could be cured no other wayes but by Blood-letting, the very worſt of Remedies, whereof the King of <hi>France</hi> made the firſt experience, and no where ſo much; by whoſe Example the King of <hi>Spain</hi> afterwards did the like; and other Princes imitating them, it is ſince become a common pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe. This troubled her the more, in reſpect of the advantages taken by the adverſe Party, the Papiſts; who being more ſtrictly united by theſe Diviſions amongſt the Proteſtants, and deluded by the belief of certain groundleſs Predictions, that her Reign ſhould be but ſhort, were eaſily drawn into many deſperate Conſpiracies, which ending with the Forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their own, brought her Life and Government into continual Jeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardy.</p>

Whereunto King <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> (as ſoon as he heard of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> his Wives death) gave her a fair Invitation by his Ambaſſador, the <hi>Conde Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> whom he ſent over publickly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In fine, he omitted no Arguments to gain his end that might be rais'd from the Conſideration of her Gratitude, or his own Greatneſs. But ſhe being naturally Inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (not to ſay as ſome have ſaid) Impenetrable, leſt it to her Councel to return this grave Anſwer for her, That ſhe could not conſent to have him of all men for a Husband, without as great reflection on her Mother as her ſelf, ſince it could not be more lawful for two Siſters to marry the ſame Husband, then for two Brothers to marry the ſame Wife. Secondly, That ſhe could not conſent to a Match that was like to prove ſo unfortunate as this would be, if without Iſſue; and yet ſo much more unfortunate with it, in reſpect her Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> muſt by the ſame Obligation become ſubject to <hi>Spain,</hi> as ſhe to him. Thirdly, That nothing could more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the Eſtabliſhing that Authority which had been ſo induſtriouſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſh'd by her Father and Brother of bleſſed Memory, and conſcientiouſly rejected by her ſelf. Fourthly, That it could neither be ſatisfactory to her ſelf or Subjects, to have ſuch a King to her Husband, whoſe greateſt Concerns being neceſſarily abroad, could neither regard her nor them, as he ought, much leſs as they deſired. This Denial, though it ſeem'd rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable enough, yet King <hi>Philip</hi> inferring that ſhe diſlik'd his Perſon ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then his Propoſal, very temperately recommended his Suit to his more youthful Kinſman, <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> ſecond Son to the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who was Rival'd by <hi>Eric,</hi> eldeſt Son of <hi>Guſtavus</hi> King of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> as he by <hi>Adolph</hi> Duke of <hi>Holſt,</hi> Uncle to <hi>Frederick</hi> III. King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark:</hi> But neither of theſe being more ſucceſsful then his moſt Catholick Majeſty, the whole Parliament became Suiters to her to think of Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to eternize her Memory not ſo much by a Succeſſor, like her ſelf, as by one deſcended from her ſelf. Which ſerious addreſs ſhe anſwer'd with a Jeſt, telling them ſhe was married already: And ſhewing them a Ring on her Finger, the ſame ſhe had received at her Coronation, told them it was the Pledge of Love and Faith given her by her dear Spouſe the Kingdom of <hi>England:</hi> which words ſhe delivered with ſuch an odd kind of Pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that all the Wiſe men amongſt them thought ſhe made Fools of them, and the Fools thought themſelves made ſo much wiſer by it, as to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand her meaning to be that ſhe would not look abroad for a Husband, but take one of her own Subjects.

For marrying the Lady <hi>Iſabella,</hi> eldeſt Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to that King, it was ſuſpected that the two Crowns might thereupon unite againſt <hi>England,</hi> upon the account of the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> her Claim; who being the Daulphins Wife, and the next in Succeſſion after Queen <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth,</hi> or (as ſome will have it) in Right before her, as being the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Heir of the Lady <hi>Margaret,</hi> eldeſt Daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, was therefore the only Perſon in the World to whom ſhe could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be reconciled: holding her ſelf oblig'd by the Impulſe of Nature, Honour, and Religion, to oppoſe her (as after ſhe did) to the death, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in perhaps there was no leſs of Envy then Reaſon of State, being as much offended with her Perfections, as her Pretenſions: For that t'other was a Lady that equall'd her in all, ſurmounted her in ſome, and was inferiour to her in no reſpects but Fortune only. This as it prov'd a Feud that puzled that Age to unriddle the meaning of it, charging all the Miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding betwixt them, upon the deſpite of Fate only (which to ſpeak Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially, was never more unkind, not to ſay unjuſt, all Circumſtances of the Story conſidered, to any Soveraign Princeſs in the World, then to that poor Queen) ſo it was the wonder of this, till we ſaw by the no leſs fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Example of that Queens Grandſon, our late Soveraign, how the beſt of Princes may fall under the power of the worſt of men: For it was Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery and Feminine Diſdain queſtionleſs that firſt divided them beyond what the difference of Nation, Intereſt, or Religion could have done, which heightning their mutual Jealouſies inſenſibly, ingag'd them before they were aware, in ſuch a Game of Wit and Faction, as brought all that either had at laſt to ſtake, and made them ſo wary in their Play on both ſides, that the Set ended not as long as the one liv'd, or the other reign'd.</p>
               <p>The Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> had the advantage of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> by the Kings in her Stock, the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> being her ſecret Friends and Well-wiſhers; not to mention the nearer Obligations of her own Son, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then but young; and the Pope ever ready to pack the Cards for her as occaſion ſerved. The advantage Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had, was by the Knaves in her hand, all the factious Demagogues of <hi>Scotland</hi> being at her Devotion, and ſo dependant on her Power, that their diſloyalty ſtood her in better ſtead than the Loyalty of her own Subjects, whereof ſhe made ſo good uſe, that her over-match't Rival being never able to fix their Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, much leſs recover their Affections, was fain to ſeek for help abroad. And after ſhe became a Priſoner, finding none ſhe could truſt, was forc'd to attempt her Freedom ſingly, proceeding therein, for want of due intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, by ſuch indirect wayes and means, as prov'd very unproſperous; for the more ſhe ſtirr'd the more ſhe intangled herſelf, faſtning the Bonds beyond all poſſibility of being ſhaken off again, which (had ſhe ſate ſtill) might poſſibly have looſed of themſelves. Neither could it prove
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:51478:169"/> otherwiſe, whiles ſhe was neither able to take right meaſures of her Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries ſtrength, nor of her own weakneſs; Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> having more Subjects then ſhe knew of, for ſhe had got the Aſcendant of her Neighbours ſo far, that like her Father <hi>Henry,</hi> where ſhe made not Kings, ſhe gave them Laws. The Proteſtants, 'tis true, the only uſeful Party to her, were few in compariſon of the Papiſts, who were all inc ined to the other ſide. But the Security of Princes reſts not ſo much in the number, as in the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their People of whom, whilſt by extraordinary methods of Love, ſhe teſtified her ſelf to have ſo great a care, they made to her as extraordinary Returns of Loyalty: witneſs that voluntary <hi>Aſſociation</hi> (as 'twas call'd) which the Proteſtants ſo ſolemnly enter'd into, as ſoon as they found her imbarraſed by the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> Faction, binding themſelves with mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Oaths and Subſcriptions to each other, to proſecute all thoſe to death, who ſhould attempt any thing againſt the Queens life. This was it gave her that high repute, without which ſhe could not have given that protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhe did to thoſe of other Countries, who afterward applyed themſelves to her as the only <hi>Defender of the Faith:</hi> for though it were no more then what they were before bound to do by their Oath of Allegiance, yet being a voluntary Recognition reſulting out of the Senſe they had of their own in her danger, it made ſuch a noiſe in all Chriſtendom, that all thoſe who choſe rather to change their Country then their Religion, caſt themſelves at her feet, and where they could not come to her, ſhe ſent to them: wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the aid ſhe gave to the perſecuted Proteſtants of <hi>France,</hi> when they were overwhelmed by the unholy Confederates of the Holy League (that had ſet up a Prieſt to make way for a Cardinal, by the Murther of a King, and by the Murther of many Thouſands more, afterward made may to ſet up themſelves) to whom, as ſhe ſent no ordinary ſupply of Men, ſo ſhe gave ſo extraordinary a ſupply of Money, that <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth himſelf was pleas'd to acknowledge, he never ſaw ſo much Gold together at any one time in his whole life before. More notable yet was that aid given to the diſtreſted Proteſtants of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> when Duke <hi>D'Alva</hi> falling on them with like Fury as <hi>Veſpatian</hi> upon the Jews, put them in as great a fear of being drown'd in a deluge of Blood, as they were but a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of being overwhelm'd by that of Water; who, when their Courage was ſunk as low as their hopes, and that lay as low as their Country, for ſhe put them into a Condition not only to defend their own Liberty, but to aſſert her Soveraignty, their gratitude prompting them to ſwear Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to her, for that ſhe had (as they ſaid) an indubitable Title to thoſe Provinces by <hi>Philippa,</hi> Wife of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, who was one of the Daughters and Coheirs of Earl <hi>William</hi> the Third of <hi>Holland,</hi> a right pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent (as they alledged) to that of the King of <hi>Spain:</hi> But whether it were ſo that ſhe rather approved the change of their Principles then of their Prince, or would have the World believe ſhe rather favour'd their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion then their Rebellion; or judg'd it would be hard to make good what was ſo ill got, or was unwilling to do any thing that might give King <hi>Philip</hi> cauſe to queſtion her Gratitude, no leſs then her Juſtice, or what other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives moderated her Ambition is not known: but ſo it was, that ſhe laid aſide for the preſent the conſideration of her own Right, and to ſhew ſhe ſincerely intended that Self-denyal, ſhe aſſiſted the Spaniard with men at the ſame time ſhe ſupplyed the Dutch with Money, thereby giving thoſe cauſe to extoll her Generoſity, whiles theſe magnified her Bounty; both alike deſiring her Friendſhip, and admiring her Wiſdom, whiles the one could not tell how ſhe affected Peace, nor t'other how far ſhe inclined to War.</p>
               <pb n="317" facs="tcp:51478:169"/>
               <p>Thus ſhe preſerv'd her ſelf by Arts as well as by Arms, which was the leſs eaſie for her to do, in reſpect of the many croſs Deſigns that were then on foot in <hi>France, Spain, Germany,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> in each of which ſhe was deeply concern'd; not to ſay in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which being on the ſame Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, was under her Eye, as their Queen under her keeping. But the King of <hi>Spain</hi> finding that whatever was pretended overtly, ſhe did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand abet the Rebels of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> he ſet his thoughts upon ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Rebels of <hi>Ireland;</hi> which how much ſhe dreaded, appears by her ready acceptance of that ſeign'd Submiſſion of the Earl of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> the firſt that gave her trouble, and the laſt that repented him of it: But before he made any Rupture upon her, there happen'd a lucky hit, which contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted much to defraying the Charge ſhe foreſaw ſhe muſt be at, whenever he broke the Peace made with her. A mighty Maſs of Money, which King <hi>Philip</hi> had taken up from the <hi>Genoveſes,</hi> and other Italian Merchants, to be ſent by Sea to the Duke <hi>D'Alva,</hi> for carrying on that War of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> was drove into one of her Ports by a French Man of War, which ſhe ſeizing to her own uſe, and juſtifying her ſelf by neceſſity of State (the only reaſon for all unreaſonable actions) thought it enough to give the Proprietors Security for the Principal, without any conſideration of Intereſt. This ſo incens'd <hi>D'Alva,</hi> that he forthwith laid an Imbargo upon all the Engliſh Merchants in the <hi>Low-Countries:</hi> She to requite that, did the like upon the Dutch Merchants here, upon which <hi>Letters of Mart</hi> were granted on both ſides, and ſo that War began which ſhe liv'd not to ſee and end of: For the King of <hi>Spain</hi> (as is ſaid before) knowing the <hi>Iriſh</hi> to be naturally inclined to break out with the Itch of Rebellion, reſolv'd to inflame their Blood with the hopes of a new Change, combining with <hi>Gregory</hi> the Thirteenth to reaſſume the Country into his hands, as one of the Kingdoms reputed parcel of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Patrimony, and held of the Church (as he alledged) by the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> upon no other Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but that of Fealty to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and therefore Forfeited by the Hereſie of the Queen. His Holineſs, who has been ever very captious of all Advantages of this kind, was eaſily prevail'd with to beſtow it upon his Natural Son the Marquiſs of <hi>Vincula;</hi> to whom one <hi>Stukely</hi> an Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, being therefore dignified with the Title of Marquiſs of <hi>Lempſter,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Wexford,</hi> was appointed General, having Eight hundred <hi>Italians</hi> under his Command: Before whom was ſent as a Vant-Currier, one <hi>Fitz-Morris,</hi> with a Conſecrated Banner, two Prieſts, and three Ships. Theſe dull Rebels were to joyn with thoſe more active ones, the Earl of <hi>Deſmond</hi> and his Brothers, and were to take Livery and Seiſin till the reſt could come upon the Place. But as was the Cauſe ſo was the Succeſs: and ſitter it was that he ſhould meet with a Croſs then a Crown, that being but Chriſts Vicar, ſhould be ſo ambitious of having a Kingdom in this World, when his Lord had none for himſelf. <hi>Stukely</hi> ended his life before he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan his Rebellion; <hi>Fitz-Morris</hi> was betray'd by his Fellow-Traytors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his own Treachery could take any effect: <hi>San Joſeph</hi> that ſucceeded him (one that was half Jew and half Italian) was glad to ſecure his own with the loſs of all their Lives that were under him, whiles <hi>Deſmond</hi> the Great Rebel was forc'd to yield to lower Conditions then any of them; and the two Prieſts that attended the holy Banner were ſtarved upon the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</p>
               <p>But after theſe there ſtarted up yet ſeveral others; as the <hi>Mac Williams,</hi> ſince call'd the <hi>Burks,</hi> the <hi>Mac Connels</hi> in <hi>Connaught,</hi> the <hi>Mac Mahons</hi> and <hi>O Rorks</hi> in <hi>Monagan,</hi> the <hi>O Connors</hi> and <hi>O Mulloys</hi> in <hi>Ophaly,</hi> and ſome
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:51478:170"/> of the <hi>O Brians</hi> and <hi>Cavenaghs</hi> in <hi>Lempſter,</hi> who did what they could to raiſe Tumults, but ſo faintly, that we may rather call them Riots, then Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions, ſignifying no more to her, than the bitings of Fleas to a Lion. However, doubting how ſhe might be peſtred with more ſuch Vermine in the heat of the Summer following, ſhe took timely care to prevent the worſt: and having Intelligence given her that they intended to diſpute her Soveraignty at Sea, as they had done her Right by Land, ſhe muſter'd up all her Naval Forces, determining to carry the War as far from home as poſſibly ſhe could. Theſe were commanded by the famous <hi>Drake,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to fight them in the other World, as well as in this, advanced to the place where 'twas ſaid the Golden Apples grew, where finding no Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon to keep them, ſo fierce as himſelf, he made himſelf Maſter of as much Treaſure as might have been a ſufficient Found for a greater Empire then that he fought for, had either his Covetouſneſs held any proportion with his Courage, or his Ambition with his Activity; for he brought home, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides what was imbezled and conceal'd, above two thouſand pound weight of uncoyn'd Silver, and twelve Cheſts of ready coyn'd, and no leſs then five hundred pound weight of Gold, beſides Jewels of an ineſtimable va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, having ſeveral Carcanets of Diamonds, Rubies, Topazes, Saphires, and Emeralds of an incredible Magnitude, iſſued Silks, and other rich Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of the growth and manufacture of the Country, being thought not worth the Portage. This added no leſs to the Fame, then to the Wealth of this great Queen, who being before compar'd to <hi>Solomon</hi> for her Wiſdom, ſeem'd now not unlike him for her Opulence. But not content with this ſingle income of Glory, ſhe commanded her Fortunate Admiral back again the ſecond time, to brave them at Land as before at Sea; where, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken <hi>St. Jago, St. Domingo,</hi> and <hi>Cartagena,</hi> three of the moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Towns they had, he return'd even ſurfeited with Victory, his Head being as giddy with new Contrivances, as his mens were with the Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who, in the midſt of all their Abundance, wanting health only, were forc'd to take leave of the place, being troubled that they could bring home no greater a booty, then what was eſteem'd at One hundred thouſand pounds Sterling, and Two hundred and forty pieces of braſs Cannon to report their Victory.</p>
               <p>But becauſe this look'd like wounding that King in the hinder parts only, ſhe was not ſatisfied till ſhe gave him one blow in the Face: and accordingly ſent to defie him before his own Doors, entring his chief Port of <hi>Cales,</hi> in which they took and fired no leſs then One hundred Ships; and furniſhing themſelves with great ſtore of Ammunition and Victuals, made for the Cape of <hi>St. Vincent,</hi> where having demoliſh'd the Forts, they paſs'd on to the <hi>Aſſores,</hi> under the great Meridian, where they took a great Carack return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> which having the name of <hi>St. Philip,</hi> it was by the Superſtitious Seamen, look'd on as an ominous Preſage of the Future ill For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of their King <hi>Philip</hi> by Sea. Whilſt <hi>Drake</hi> was thus active to the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, <hi>Candiſh</hi> was no leſs buſie to the Weſtward, who having deſtroy'd ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Colonies in <hi>Chily, Peru,</hi> and <hi>Nova Hiſpania,</hi> return'd home Laden with the Spoils of Nineteen rich Ships taken in his way.</p>
               <p>And now King <hi>Philip</hi> provok'd no leſs by the ſhame, then the continued loſs he had ſuſtain'd for above two years together, with redoubled diligence and charge got ready a mighty Fleet, hoping to perform ſome wonders ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the Expectation of the Time, as well as of the Importance of the Affair, it being by Aſtronomers call'd <hi>The wonderful Year,</hi> and being the great Clymacterich of the World, they concluded it muſt produce ſome
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:51478:170"/> extraordinary Effects. Neither indeed was there any thing then in the World ſo extraordinary and amazing as the ſight of that moving Wood of his, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of no leſs then One hundred and fifty tall Ships, which carri'd in them beſides all Habiliments of War, Twenty thouſand men, and expected Fifty thouſand more to be joyn'd with them, that the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> was to bring out of <hi>Flanders:</hi> all which were to be Landed in the <hi>Thames</hi> mouth, that ſo by ſeizing on the Head, they might the more eaſily command every Member of the whole Body of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Well may we imagine that the report of ſuch a Preparation as this (the work of no leſs then three years time) was heard further then the noiſe of their Cannon could (though 'tis incredible how far they were heard;) and one would have thought the Sound of that terrible Name they gave their Fleet, <hi>El Invincible Armado,</hi> might have been ſufficient to have made an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Earth-quake throughout Chriſtendom: But it ſeems the Adamantine hearts of the Neighbour Princes were ſo impenetrable, that it did not much move them; for being ſatisfied in the Counterpoiſe of the Queens Power, they ſtood at Gaze ſeemingly unconcern'd. The Queen had prepar'd a double Guard, one for the Land, t'other for the Sea: that by Land was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into two Armies, the one conſiſting of Two and twenty thouſand Foot, and One thouſand Horſe, commanded by the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> whoſe Poſt was at <hi>Tilbury:</hi> The other conſiſting of Four and twenty thouſand Foot, and Two thouſand Horſe, which were the Guard of her Perſon, were Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Lord <hi>Hunſden;</hi> the Sea-ports being Garriſon'd with Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand old Souldiers, who were ſeconded by the Train'd Bands in the reſpective Counties where they lay. The Guard by Sea conſiſted of One hundred and forty Ships, divided into three Squadrons: The two firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of Fifty, each under the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> the Admiral, and Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> the Vice-Admiral, waited the coming of the Enemy in <hi>Plymouth</hi> Road: The laſt Squadron of Forty, Commanded by the Rere-Admiral the Lord <hi>Henry Seymour,</hi> ſecond Son to the Duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> rode between <hi>Dunkirk</hi> and <hi>Callais,</hi> to prevent any Conjunction with the Prince of <hi>Parma.</hi> With this great Body ſhe deſign'd to ſhew the World her Grandeur, but when ſhe meant to ſhew her Power, ſhe made uſe but of Fifteen of them.</p>
               <p>Now as it happens oftentimes, that great Calmes precede great Storms, ſo the Catholick King hoping to out-wit the Heretick Queen, a little before his great Fleet was ready to come forth, diſſembling a paſſionate deſire of Peace, preſs'd hard for a Treaty; but whilſt he thought to deceive her, he was deceiv'd by her: For ſhe, to return the trick upon him, conſented to the Propoſal, and by the ſending her Commiſſioners to <hi>Oſtend,</hi> ſo poſſeſs'd him of the ſuppos'd Advantage he had gotten by it, that it's thought it made him appear a little ſooner then he would; for before they could enter into the buſineſs, he was entred into the Britiſh Seas, and was no leſs ſhock'd when he found her in readineſs, then he expected ſhe ſhould have been if he had taken her unawares. This made them reſolve rather to make a Chaſe fight, then lye by't, though they had the advantage of the Wind, their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour being preſerv'd till they came to <hi>Callais,</hi> for that it was ſuppos'd all the haſte they made away, tended only to the Conjunction with the Prince of <hi>Parma;</hi> but after they cut their Cables (having not the Courage to ſtay to weigh Anchor) and made all the Sail they could to fly from only eight Fire-ſhips, it then plainly appear'd they neither underſtood their own Strength nor hers. But theſe Ships being the firſt of that kind that ever were ſeen, we may allow them to be <hi>The Wonder that gave Name to that wonderful Year.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="320" facs="tcp:51478:171"/>
               <p>In this great Conflict were loſt more then half of the Spaniſh Fleet, of the Engliſh only one Ship, and that of no great Conſideration: ſo that 'twas believ'd, having ſounded the danger of our Dark Seas, paſſing round by the North, they had taken their final Leave of <hi>England.</hi> However, the Queen was reſolv'd not to leave them ſo, but after much miſchief done them by ſeveral Privateers, whom ſhe permitted to go forth upon their own Charge, ſhe reſolv'd to become her ſelf the Aggreſſor, and repay to him the great diſhonour of his Invaſion; it being an Indignity not to be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by Princes, becauſe it cannot be forgotten by their People, who can never be diſcharg'd from the Fears they have of him who has once ſet upon them, till there be ſome Confront given, that may aſſure them their own Prince is not ſo weak, as the Enemy, by ſeeking him out, would have the World believe.</p>
               <p>The Fleet ſhe ſet forth conſiſted of One hundred and fifty Sail, yet was not call'd the <hi>Invincible,</hi> though it prov'd ſo, being commanded by the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> as General at Land, and the Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> as General at Sea, who ſetting upon <hi>Cales</hi> the ſecond time, took it, and in it, all the Wealth that may be imagin'd to be lodg'd in ſuch a Store-houſe as that is; and after having burn'd all the Ships they found there (for which they were offer'd Two Millions of <hi>Ducats</hi> if they would ſpare them) they ſpoil'd the whole Iſland, and demoliſh'd all the Forts, and did, as 'tis thought, as much Damage as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to Twenty Millions of <hi>Ducats</hi> more: To requite which, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> rigg'd up another Navy, and mann'd it with <hi>Iriſh</hi> Runnagado's, but either their Skill or their Courage failed them, at leaſt the Winds did not ſo favour them, but that the Expedition came to nought.</p>
               <p>And now when all the Storms at Sea ſeem'd to have been blown over and paſt, there roſe a Cloud at Land which gave the Queen greater apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of danger then ever ſhe had before. The French King, who was joyn'd with her in a League Offenſive and Defenſive againſt <hi>Spain,</hi> and had reap'd this good Effect by it, to recover <hi>Amiens,</hi> which the <hi>Spaniard</hi> had ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd by the help of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> only, yeilding to the Importunities of the Pope and his own People, made his Peace without her, who quitting his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion at the ſame time he quit her Friendſhip, 'twas believ'd they would all joyn to ſet upon her at once. Hereupon there were great Debates in Councel upon the point of her cloſing with the Spaniard, who ſeem'd much to deſire a Peace. <hi>Eſſex,</hi> the great Idol of the Sword-men, was for continuing the War; <hi>Burleigh,</hi> who was the great Patron of the Pen-men, was for the Peace. And it ſeems they argued the matter ſo warmly, that being ſcarce able to keep Peace amongſt themſelves, 'twas not likely they ſhould obtain it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad: For <hi>Eſſex</hi> could not forbear unſeemly Reflections upon the old man, nor he from retorting them back as ſharply, who 'tis ſaid (being more witty in his Anger) call'd for a Bible at the Table, and ſhewing him that Verſe in the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> where 'tis ſaid <hi>The bloody minded man ſhall not live out half his dayes,</hi> gave him grave warning by an ominous Preſage of that which follow'd (for we know how ſhortly after he ſwell'd and burſt.) However the Queen mov'd with like Zeal to Religion, as <hi>Eſsex</hi> was with hatred to the Spaniard, inclin'd to his Opinion; whereupon <hi>Cecil</hi> ſubmitted to her Judgment, but pray'd to have the Queſtion put firſt to the States of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> her Confederates, Whether they would agree to her making Peace: and knowing it to be againſt their Intereſt ſo to do, he took the Advantage of their Refuſal to demand an aid towards the carrying on of the War; out of whom, by that trick of State, he did her this good Service againſt her will, to ſcrew Eight hundred thouſand pounds, which being to be paid
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:51478:171"/> by Thirty thouſand pounds yearly, for which the Queen had Cautionary Towns given as a Security, it look'd ſo like a Tribute, that after their having offer'd her the Soveraignty (as they did) 'tis hard to prove it was not ſo.</p>
               <p>And now caſting up the Accompt betwixt her and the Spaniard, who was her greateſt, and not to ſay her only Enemy (for the Pope, however he bore no leſs hatred to her, yet being at that diſtance as he was, he could not come to cloſe grapple with her, and as his quarrel was chiefly Spiritual, ſo his Machinations were for the moſt part inviſible, proceeding by ſecret under-hand Inſtigations of ſuch Perſons, as having not credit enough for raiſing War, had recourſe only to ſuch Clancular Contrivances and darker Treaſons, which ſhe eaſily enervated by the Spell of that Politick Motto of hers, <hi>VIDEO &amp; TACEO,</hi> which ſhe took up by the Example of her ſage Grandfather <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, who though he was very wiſe, affected to ſeem wiſer than he was, by pretending to more intelligence then really he had, whereby as he, ſo ſhe left that impreſſion upon their Guilt who hated her, that many of them durſt not attempt the betraying her, for fear of being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd themſelves, and perhaps by themſelves; as was that unfortunate Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain <hi>Squire,</hi> one of the Grooms of her Stable, who being tempted by an Engliſh Jeſuite in <hi>Spain,</hi> to poyſon the Pommel of her Saddle, was by the Tempter himſelf, when he found it took not effect, diſcover'd and accus'd, and confeſſing the Fact, executed for it) caſting up the Accompt betwixt her and the Spaniard, it doth appear at the loweſt rate ſet upon his Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in conteſting with her, that ſhe conſum'd him no leſs then Five hundred Millions of <hi>Ducats,</hi> beſides what he ſuffer'd by the Revolt of the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> which he had unqueſtionably reduc'd, had not ſhe interpos'd with her Power to protect them, for which they paid her well at laſt. The only Requital he made her was by upholding the Iriſh Rebellion, which coſt her not half the money ſhe had of their Hogen-mogen-ſhips: for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhe was induc'd to ſend over a greater Army then ever <hi>Ireland</hi> had ſeen before, when <hi>Oneil</hi> ſeiz'd the Fort of <hi>Blackwater,</hi> and took his firſt and laſt Revenge upon the Engliſh there, to wit, Twenty thouſand Foot, and One thouſand three hundred Horſe to reinforce the Governours there, after the Landing of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> under <hi>Don Aquila,</hi> yet ſhe had a ſuitable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn in opening ſeveral Paſſages, till then altogether unknown to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> whereby ſhe found out convenient Scituations for ſeveral Colonies, that have ſince Cultivated many thouſands of (before unprofitable) Acres, and made Seats fit for men to dwell in, which till then were the Receptacles of Beaſts only, or Men more Savage then they. So that what her great Enemy took from her Peace, he added to her Glory, who in deſpight of the Love and Hate of all thoſe great Princes that courted or contemn'd her, dyed a Virgin and Unconquer'd; having this happineſs by coming to the Crown ſo cloſe after the Reign of her buſling Father, to be ſerv'd by a race of choice Men, that having given him ſufficient proof of their Loyalty, made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves yet more valuable to her by their Experience, having by the Gravity and Grandeur of ſome of them, and by the Courage and Conduct of others, ſo well ſetled the Foundations of Government, that notwithſtanding five ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Changes in Religion, and the Interpoſition of a Woman, a Stranger, and a Child, they deliver'd up the Scepter to her in Peace, and ſtanding round the Throne, with like Conſtancy defended her, as ſhe defended their Faith, which as it was not without great difficulty, ſo perhaps it had not been without an impoſſibility of Succeſs, had ſhe not ſtrengthen'd the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of their Authority by the Authority of her own Example.</p>

But how melancholy a life he lead under his next Regent the Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi> who, under pretence of keeping all Papiſts and Factious Perſons from him, ſuffer'd him to ſee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt no body, appears by that ſtrict Order of his, by which every Earl was forbid to approach his Preſence with any more then two attending him, every Baron with any above one, and all of leſſer Quality were not to come but ſingle. Upon this, 'tis true, the offended Nobility (to affront <hi>Morton</hi>) declar'd him <hi>Major,</hi> and made ſome ſhew of leaving him to his own diſpoſe, but in reſpect he was but twelve years old, they thought fit to appoint him eleven Lords more to be aſſiſtant in Councel to him, three and three by turns, which in effect was to put twelve Regents over him inſtead of one, which was deſign'd by ſome that intended their own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement more then his. Thus he ſuffer'd during the Nonage of his years: How he ſuffer'd further during the Nonage of his Power, will appear in the Sequel.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Morton,</hi> notwithſtanding the Preſcript Form of Government, drew to himſelf (being one of the twelve) the Adminiſtration of all Affairs, and keeping the Power ſtill within his own hands, as the King within his own Power, admitted none to ſee or ſpeak with him but whom he thought fit; whereby he was now brought to looſe his Liberty wholly, becauſe t'other had loſs his Authority in part only. This Tyranny held till the Lords head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Earl of <hi>Athole,</hi> freed him by force of Arms: After which, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving himſelf clearly manumitted out of his Pupillage, to ſhew himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to none but himſelf, he began to ſingle out ſuch Friends for his Confidents, as by nearneſs of Blood, or the nobleneſs of their Natures, he judg'd moſt worthy to be truſted. Two there were above the reſt, on whom he ſeem'd to caſt a diſproportionate Grace; theſe were <hi>Eſme</hi> Lord <hi>Aubigny,</hi> Grandſon of the Lord <hi>John Stuart,</hi> his Grandfathers younger Brother (whom he created firſt Earl, and after Duke of <hi>Lenox</hi>) and <hi>Charles</hi> Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> who being a <hi>Hamilton,</hi> was his near Kinſman too: but both of them being ſuſpected to be of the <hi>French</hi> Faction, it gave freſh occaſion of offence to the chief of the Factions there, and no leſs umbrage to the jealous Queen here, who knew the former of the two to be much honoured by the <hi>Guiſes.</hi> This new conceiv'd Envy heightned the old Rancor of the mutinous Nobility, and made them have recourſe to the ſame Remedy for prevention of the ſame Miſchief as before; whereunto there being a fair opportunity given by the abſence of theſe Lords (the one being in a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, t'other at <hi>Edenburgh</hi>) the Earl of <hi>Gowry,</hi> with whom confederated the young Earl of <hi>Marre,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Lindſey,</hi> finding the King alone at St. <hi>Johnſtons,</hi> invited him over to his Caſtle of <hi>Reuthen.</hi> As ſoon as they had him there they made him Priſoner, and accuſing the two Lords as Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Proteſtant Religion, having firſt put all his truſty Servants from him, they forc'd him by an Inſtrument under his Hand and Seal, to baniſh the Lord <hi>Aubigny,</hi> and to impriſon the Lord <hi>Arran;</hi> and which was yet more inſupportable, compell'd him to approve all that they did by Letters to Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> But it was not long ere the death of the Duke of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nox</hi> in <hi>France</hi> (who, 'tis ſaid, however dyed a Proteſtant) made the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators ſo ſecure in the poſſeſſion of him, that he found the means to make his eſcape from them: And recovering himſelf now the ſecond time, as one that once more became Lord of himſelf, he recall'd his truſty Councellor
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:51478:177"/> the Lord <hi>Arran,</hi> by whoſe advice he was guided in all his Concerns. This ſo provoked <hi>Gowry</hi> beyond all patience, that in defiance of all Reaſon as well as of all Right, he made a ſecond attempt upon him: But as thoſe who are fore-warn'd are fore-arm'd, ſo the King having an eye upon him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated his purpoſe, and made him what he ſhould himſelf have been made by him, a Priſoner at Mercy, whilſt his Complices eſcap'd into <hi>England,</hi> to ſeek Protection from Q. <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> Who hoping to have prevented <hi>Gowry</hi>'s Sentence, diſpatch'd away her Secretary <hi>Walſingham</hi> to the King, to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him to take heed how he was led away by evil Counſellors, and to ſhew him how difficult a thing it was to diſtinguiſh betwixt good and bad Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, at his Age, being then but eighteen years old: to which the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd a ſudden, not to ſay a ſharp Anſwer, That he was an abſolute Prince, and would not that others ſhould appoint him Counſellors whom he liked not. Wherewith the teſty Queen was ſo offended, that ſhe ſet her Terriers upon Incouraging the factious Miniſtry (whereof there was good ſtore there, and thoſe fit Tools for her purpoſe) to ſay thoſe things which became not her to own, who clamoring upon his Government, and raiſing many ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders upon Himſelf and Councel, tending to the making them Popiſhly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, were thereupon cited to Anſwer for their Seditious Practiſes: But they refuſed to appear, avowing that the Pulpit was exempt from all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Authority, and that no Eccleſiaſtical Perſons were accomptible for what they preach'd, to any but to God and their Conſiſtory. In the mean time the Queen follow'd the blow, and furniſhing the proſcrib'd Lords with Money, ſecretly diſmiſs'd them home: Who as ſoon as they return'd, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Credit of declaring for the Confirmation of the Truth of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, for freeing the King from evil Counſellors, and maintaining Amity with the Proteſtant Intereſt of <hi>England,</hi> rais'd Eight thouſand men in an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, with whom they marched up directly to Court, and ſo far ſurpriz'd the King, that he was forced to render himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to them, and to ingage to give up to their Mercy all their Adverſaries, and who they were, was left to their own liberty to declare: Next, he was compell'd to put into their hands the four Keys of the Kingdom, <hi>Dumbritton, Edinburgh, Tantallon,</hi> and <hi>Sterling</hi> Caſtles. After which <hi>Glames,</hi> one of the principal Rebels, was made Captain of his Guard: All perſons out-law'd for Treaſon had their Utlaries revers'd: all the bad Subjects were declar'd good, and ſome of the beſt declar'd Traytors. A Treaty of Peace was concluded with <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> upon Conditions that the Queen-Mother ſhould never be releas'd, and in order to the bringing on her Tryal, as after it fell out: which Tryal of the Mother prov'd yet a greater tryal to the King her Son, who having before loſt his Father and Grandfather by a diſmal Fate (both privately murther'd) was much more abaſht to appear ſo much a King, and no King, as to be a helpleſs Spectator now of his Mothers Tragedy, made away by ſuch a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Tryal, as ſeem'd to proclaim his weakneſs and ſhame, more then her guilt. This ſeem'd to be the very dregs of that bitter Cup whereof he had drank ſo largely a little before, but being, as he hop'd, the laſt draught he was to take of Infelicity, he bore it with ſuitable patience, as became a Chriſtian and a King: But his Deſtinies decreed that there muſt yet be one Throw more before the Birth of his Greatneſs. For however his Majeſty clear'd up from the time of his Mothers departure, like the Sun after a ſtormy Morning, which becomes brighter and brighter, as it draws nearer its Meridian, yet there happen'd after all this an Eclipſe, that laſting on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly half an hour, had like to have extinguiſh'd all his Light and Glory, if a Hand from Heaven had not reſcued him. For the young <hi>Gowry,</hi> who at the
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:51478:178"/> time of his Fathers death, and long after, continued in <hi>Italy</hi> (the Country where they are learn'd in the Art of Revenge) having found an opportunity to draw him again into that fatal Caſtle, where he was before Priſoner to his Father, under pretence of ſhewing him ſome Chymical Rarities, got him up into ſome higher Rooms, whiles his Servants were retired to eat (it being preſently after he had dined himſelf) where, by the help of his younger Brother and another appointed to aſſiſt them, they intended to have aſſaſſinated him, had not he that was to do the horrid Deed, not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lented at the very inſtant when he drew his Sword upon him, but turn'd his point upon his Fellow Regicide, and thereby gave him time to ſtep to a Window and call for help, which came ſo timely to him, as to reſcue him by the death of the two <hi>Gowrys.</hi> This, though it was the laſt of Treaſons, was not yet the laſt of dangers he met with: For after this, mov'd by what Obligations, beſides that of Love, I know not (which commonly is not ſo domineering a Paſſion over Princes as private men) he run as much danger at Sea, as he had before at Land, expoſing himſelf to the mercy of that unruly Element, at the moſt dangerous Seaſon of the year, to fetch over his Queen, the Daughter of <hi>Frederick</hi> II. King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> who having attempted ſeveral times to come to him, was drove back (and as 'tis ſaid by the power of Sorcery) into <hi>Norwey;</hi> which hazard being afterward recompenced by the ſatisfaction he had in the Vertue of his Wife, and the hopes conceiv'd of the Children he had by her, two Sons and a Daughter, as he had no further cauſe to Fear, ſo he had nothing further to wiſh, but that lucky hit that came by the death of the late Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> to have the Glory of bringing this Iſle, ſo long divided from all the World, to be at Unity within it ſelf.</p>
               <p>And now to the end he might take the Inclinations of the People at the firſt bound (wherein no man was ever more skilfull then he) he abrogated the two names of Diſtinction, <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and reconciled them to each other, under the comprehenſive Appeliation of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring <hi>England</hi> to its old Name, as he from whom he claim'd, had reſtor'd the Crown to its ancient ſtock. Fain he would have brought them under the unity of the ſame Laws, but finding neither Nation pleas'd with the Propoſal, either being partial to their own Conſtitutions, as fitted with due and different reſpects, to their different Tempers, Intereſts, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties, he quitted that Deſign as a Labour of too hard digeſtion. But however the Reaſons of State varied, he was reſolv'd to reconcile the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the two Churches, as in an Union of Poſſeſſion, ſo in an Uniformity of Government and Worſhip: Thoſe of his own Country having then no other Form, but that impos'd upon them by <hi>Boanerges Fox,</hi> without taking Counſel of Prince or Prelate, which was not otherwiſe to be made good, but by the ſame Violence with which it was at the firſt introduced againſt the Will of any of the Nobility, but ſuch whoſe Anceſtors were brib'd by the Alienation of the Church Lands. But before he could impoſe any thing upon them, underſtanding there were many here in <hi>England</hi> that followed that Claſſical way, he reſolv'd to have a free Conference with the ableſt of their Demagogues, to the end, that ſounding the depth of their Principles, he might, if poſſible, fathom that of their Piety, which no man could bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter do then himſelf, being an univerſal Scholar, as well read in Men as Books, and ſo tranſcendently verſed in the laſt, that he was not improperly ſtil'd <hi>Rex Platonicus.</hi> How confident he was of his skill in diſcuſſing all points Theological, appears by his entring the Liſt with Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the Fourth, and making him give ground. Neither was he a little provoked
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:51478:178"/> to this Spiritual Warfare by a clamorous Petition pretended from a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand diſſatisfied Miniſters, who not having yet matter enough of juſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, made up the Cry by the number of Complainants. To whom, while he was conſidering what Anſwer to give, or rather how to make them anſwer themſelves (as after he did, by taking each of them apart, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding him to ſet down in Writing, what it was he ſingly deſired; which when compared altogether, prov'd ſo contradictory and abſurd, that like men brought to cudgel one another in the dark, they withdrew with bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Pates) he was interrupted by the Diſcovery of a Treaſon, which (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on ſo early in the Dawn of his Government) could not well be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered what it was, nor whereto it tended. For whereas moſt other Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies are hatch'd by men of the ſame Faction, Intereſt, and Judgment, this ſtrangely involv'd People of all ſorts and conditions, without reſpect to any Repugnancy of Quality or Concern; Prieſts and Laymen, Papiſts and Puritans, Noblemen and Ignoble, Citizens and Country-men, were all piec'd up together in the ſame Combination; but whether ingaged by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Ambition, Covetouſneſs, or Malice, was not known, or at leaſt by the Kings Wiſdom conceal'd: However by the well-known Names of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Conſpirators, the Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> who was Lord-Warden of the <hi>Cinque Ports,</hi> the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> of <hi>Wilton,</hi> who had a great Poſt in the late Queens Government, Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> Lord-Warden of the <hi>Stanneries,</hi> Sir <hi>John Forteſcue</hi> Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir <hi>Griffith Markham,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Parham,</hi> and ſeveral others, all men of good Families, and of as good E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, one would have thought it a ſoberer and deeper deſign then it proved to be. Some think their intention was to have ſeiz'd on the Perſons of the King and Queen, and their Children, and ſo to have made Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with him for the Kingdom in general, and perhaps for themſelves in particular; being perſwaded by ſome cunning Caſuiſt amongſt them, That it could be no Treaſon, being enter'd into before the King was Crown'd and Anointed. And in caſe they could not bring the King to their terms, 'twas ſaid they reſolv'd to ſet up the Title of the Lady <hi>Arabella,</hi> as the next pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive Heir to the Crown, being ſole Daughter of <hi>Charles</hi> Earl of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nox,</hi> younger Brother to the Kings Grandfather, whom the King, when her Father dyed, put beſides that Title (as by Cuſtom of <hi>Scotland</hi> he might, being a Donation during his Minority) to give it to his Coſin <hi>Eſme</hi> Lord <hi>Aubigny,</hi> the Heir Male of the Lord <hi>John,</hi> the other younger Brother. Now that which gave colour to this unreaſonable Conjecture of ſetting up this Lady, was the particular reſpect Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> profeſt to her: but if his enmity to <hi>Spain</hi> had not been a more unpardonable ſin then his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with her, the Charge Count <hi>Gundamore</hi> brought againſt him could not have been ſo much more preſſing upon him, then the Attorney Generals upon his Fellows, to make his much Merit no leſs criminal then their much Guilt: and which was more unlucky, to render him a greater Sufferer by the Kings Mercy, then divers of them were by his Juſtice; who, having freed him after Condemnation, was prevail'd with by the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him after that freedom, contrary to the opinion of divers learned Gown-men, who held that his Majeſties Pardon lay incluſively in that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion he gave him afterward upon his ſetting out to Sea; it being incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous that he ſhould have had the diſpoſing of the lives of others, who was not clearly Maſter of his own.

Theſe Propoſals of his being inforced by a not unlearned Diſcourſe, however more like an Orator then a Divine, he concluded with ſundry Objections: 1.

They deem'd it moſt laudable, as being warranted by the practice of the Primitive Church, from the very Apoſtles time. Laſtly, they judg'd it neceſſary that the Children ſhould receive Benediction by the Impoſition of Hands, after the Example of<note n="†" place="margin">Matt. 19.13:</note> Chriſt himſelf. This Anſwer being ſo ſolid, that it could not well admit of any Reply, he very dexterouſly grafted a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire upon it, That every private Paſtor might Confirm as well as the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop: But Doctor <hi>Andrews</hi> challenging him to ſhew where ever it was done by any but Biſhops, he loſt the Point for want of ready proof. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this he objected in the ſecond place againſt <hi>Abſolution,</hi> as ſavouring too much of Popery. To which was anſwer'd, That the Commiſſion of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning Sins was originally given by Chriſt himſelf, and allowed of by the Church of <hi>England</hi> upon no other but Goſpel Terms of ſincere Repentance and amendment of Life, which differenc'd it ſufficiently from the Popes Pardons and Indulgences granted upon far other and eaſier reſpects; and being agreeable to the practice of other Reformed Churches, particularly that of <hi>Geneva</hi> (the pattern which they themſelves deſired to follow) it was thought not only immodeſt and inconvenient, but ſcarcely juſtifiable before God or Man to condemn the practice of it. Which Anſwer, how it ſatisfied him at that preſent time I know not, but I have been credibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, that when he was upon the point of Death, he earneſtly deſired the Abſolution of a Reverend Divine that came to pray with him, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his hands between his own, kiſs'd them with all imaginary ſhew of Devotion and Humility.

Hereupon one of the out-lying Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors ſallied forth impertinently enough, and deſired to know how far an Ordinance of the Church was binding without Impeachment of Chriſtian Liberty: Whom immediately the King took off with a ſharp Reply, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, That as the Church taught him Faith, he would teach him Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.

Whoſe Wiſdom by this Diſcovery was magnified to that degree, that all men look'd on him as another <hi>Solomon</hi> in point of King-craft; and had his bodily abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities born any proportion to thoſe of his mind, doubtleſs the Women would have extoll'd him no leſs then the men.</p>
               <p>Having now ſetled all things to his mind in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> he proceeded in the next place to the Reformation of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> whither he ſent divers grave and learned Divines upon an Apoſtolick Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſy, to prepare the way for the eſtabliſhment of a like Hierarchy there as here. Which Work prov'd ſo ſucceſsful, that without any great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute they admitted as many Biſhops as there had been ancient Sees in that Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> Thirteen; of which number there were three that received their Conſecration from the Arch-biſhop of <hi>York,</hi> who was, it ſeems, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted and obeyed as Metropolitan of that Kingdom till the Year 1478. all the reſt being Conſecrated at home by their own Prelates, whoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was not long after confirmed both by Synodical Acts, and Acts of Parliament. After which the Liturgy, and certain Books of Canons, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted out of ſcatter'd Acts of their old Aſſemblies were likewiſe rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and confirmed by Parliament: And at the Aſſembly of <hi>Perth</hi> (now call'd St. <hi>Johnſtown</hi>) there paſs'd two years after (though not without great difficulty) thoſe five notable Articles for 1. Epiſcopal Confirmation, 2. Kneeling at the Communion, 3. Private Baptiſme, 4. the Celebration of
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:51478:180"/> the four great Anniverſary Feaſts of the Birth, Paſſion, and Reſurrection of our Saviour, and the Pentecoſt, and 5. for the ſetling the Church Habits. All which were likewiſe confirm'd by Act of Parliament, the great Lords having as yet heard nothing of any Commiſſion of Surrendries, which was that great Rock of Offence againſt which his Succeſſor King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt did ſo unluckily daſh himſelf to pieces.</p>
               <p>Due care being thus taken for Eſtabliſhment of Truth and Order in the Church, the next great Work was to eſtabliſh quiet in the State, that <hi>Righteouſneſs and Peace might kiſs each other,</hi> which he judged to be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration not leſs neceſſary then prudent: the active Government of his Predeceſſor Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who led all the brave men in her time to hard duty, having tired out almoſt a l the ſtirring Spirits of the Nation. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, though it did eaſe, it did not generally pleaſe the People, the humor of Fighting being not ſo wholly ſpent, but that it broke out afterward to worſe purpoſe; it being in our Fate, as has been obſerv'd by ſome Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly States-men, that whenever we are long kept from quarrelling with others, we are apt to quarrel with one another.

               <p>Peace he had at home without his ſeeking for it: <hi>O Neil</hi> the great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturber of his Predeceſſors quiet being preſented to him as a Priſoner by the Lord <hi>Mountjoy,</hi> as ſoon almoſt as he came in, which gave him the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to begin with the ſettlement of <hi>Ireland</hi> firſt, by giving the poſſeſſion of the whole Province of <hi>Ulſter (O Neil</hi>'s Country, and the ſink of Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) to the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> who thereupon ſetled two Colonies there, the one at <hi>Derry,</hi> every ſince call'd <hi>London-derry;</hi> t'other at <hi>Colraine,</hi> which they ſtor'd with Four hundred Artizans; whilſt the King, for the better ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying them with Souldiers, erected a new Order of Knighthood, call'd <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronets,</hi> from their taking place next the Sons of <hi>Barons,</hi> each of which was ingaged to lay down as much money at the Sealing of his Patent, as would maintain thirty Foot Souldiers one whole year, at the rate of Eight pence a day a piece, which came to twenty ſhillings a day: And the Complement of theſe Knights being Two hundred, there was a compleat Eſtabliſhment of Three thouſand Souldiers without any further noiſe, to be ready for his Service whenever he had occaſion to make uſe of them.</p>
               <p>Now in order to the having Peace abroad, there needed no more but to renew the Leagues he had made before with the Princes his Neighbours, under another ſtile.

And as he lov'd to Droll, ſo he would ſometimes pleaſe himſelf by ſingling out ſome wiſe Fool of the Company, and be very grave with him, in asking his Opinion of ſomething that never was, nor nere was like to be, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwhile giving him ſome little State hints, as who ſhould ſay, <hi>A word to the Wiſe,</hi> whereby he not only obliged them to keep ſecret the nothing he had intruſted them with, but by that Secrecy created in him a ſelf-conceipt that made him matter of much Mirth another time: In fine, he had ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a Faculty in ſeeming to be what he was not, and in being what he pleas'd, that if it be true, that Diſſimulation is a Vertue in Kings, though it be not ſo in private men, he was ſo great a Maſter of Art in that Liberal Science, that he could diſſemble without ſeeming to be a Diſſembler, and vary his ſhape ſo naturally, and ſo eaſily, that he could cozen whom he pleas'd, and when he pleas'd, though in truth he never cozened any Body, unleſs it were himſelf, and that he did very often, being not ſeldom pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd with by thoſe of his brib'd Country-men about him, to make under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand Agreements with the Farmers of his Revenue, whilſt his Councel were contriving how to raiſe their Rents to ten times the value.

But when he came to have any thing to do with his Parliament, who were to treat with him upon the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith in the behalf of the People, he alwayes gave them a penny-worth for their Penny; and as oft as they preſented h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And that which made this Misfortune the more notorious was, That the ſame Courſe he took to make the matter bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, made it worſe: For having no ready money to ſet out a Navy, nor means to get any, he was forced to make uſe of a little <hi>Treaſure-trove</hi> (if I may call it) for which he was beholding to his Attorney-General <hi>Noy,</hi> who incouraged him to lay a Tax upon the People, by the dubious Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of an antiquated, and (as it was afterward call'd) Arbitrary Law, whereby the Kings of <hi>England</hi> heretofore had power given them to impoſe a Naval Tax, in caſe of eminent danger by Sea: A Law, which at the firſt making was judg'd to be as reaſonable as neceſſary, being intended to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the frequent Incurſions of the <hi>Danes</hi> before the <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueſt: but all Fears of that Nature having vaniſh'd ſo long ſince, to revive it now, was look'd on like the drawing forth of an old ruſty Sword, which gave ſuch a wound to the Liberty of the Subject, that though it were not very deep, rankled to that degree, as notwithſtanding the many good applications afterward to heal it, the inflammation could not be taken off till it turn'd to a Gangreen. Thus, whilſt he reſolv'd to do nothing but by Law, the legality of his proceedings is taken for an act of the higheſt Tyranny. Neither was this the worſt on't, to ſee his Fleet as it were dry-foundred at Land before it could put to Sea; for the Parliament, inſtead of maintaining his, buſied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wholly in aſſerting their own Rights, bringing them to the old Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and the <hi>Petition of Right.</hi> Which, however it ſeem'd
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:51478:184"/> to be bad enough in the Intention, all Circumſtances then conſider'd, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved yet worſe in the Explication, being conſtru'd not long after to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of his Right of Tonnage and Poundage; in diſcuſſing whereof, they committed a Violence upon themſelves, which declared what they intended upon him, by leaving a Preſident that as much out-laſted their Cauſe, as the Cauſe did their Priviledge, ſhutting up the Doors of their Houſe (as if guilty that they deſerv'd to be diſturb'd) till they had fully vented their Paſſion, in ſome menacing Vores that urg'd him to diſſolve them, by ſuch a kind of Force, as was every whit as rare as their Inſolence, the breaking up their Doors (for ſo he was fain to do before he could get Entrance, though himſelf was there in Perſon to demand it) making ſo great a noiſe, that it was heard not only thorow every part of the diſcontented City, but Kingdom; and the ſound became the more terrible by the ominous Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berations from <hi>Scotland,</hi> who ecchoed to thoſe Murmurs here with ſuch a diſmal Concordance, as ſhew'd to what Inſtrument they were tuned.</p>
               <p>This drew him into that Kingdom, to correct the growing Diſtemper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it becauſe too virulent, wherein he proceeded as wiſe Phyſitians do, that draw the pains from the Head by Applications to the Feet: but as it is hard to diſcern the true meaning of any mans Intention (which being the Soul of every Action, is inviſible) and very eaſie to abuſe it with a maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Interpretation, that is not only againſt its own, but againſt all Sence and Reaſon; ſo it happen'd to him, who beginning with the Ratification of the Negative Confeſſion ſubſcrib'd by his Father and the whole Kingdom, <hi>Anno</hi> 1580. (which was a Renuntiation of the Papal Authority, and all the corrupt Principles depending thereon) he was charged by thoſe that had before felt the ſmart of the Commiſſion of Surrendries, and were inforc'd to diſgorge thoſe Sacrilegious grants they had obtained during his Fathers minority, to have a deſign of bringing in Popery; a word that turn'd eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans Blood into Choler, and gave the hotteſt allarm to tender Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences that ever that cold Clime knew, the train of whoſe Calumnies was ſo laid, that it quickly took fire here in <hi>England,</hi> where the Presbyterian (as yet call'd the Puritan) Party, having, as they thought, matter enough of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal long before, from the unhappy Toleration of Sports on the Sabbath-day, and the turning of the Communion Table Altar-wiſe, began to chackle (as one expreſſes it) like the Geeſe in the Capitol, beſpattering the Biſhops with that vehemency, that much of their unbeſeeming Froath fell upon the King himſelf. And for the more intire Concurrence of Civil and Religious Clamors, the ſame evil Spirit that furniſh'd them with meet matters of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, turning Man-Midwife, eaſed them of many a Spiritual Throw, by opening the Womb of their Conſpiracy before its full time, making way for the new birth of that long expected Parliament, from whoſe heat all the Factions took life, and like quickned Snakes, began to hiſs with ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venom'd rage, as ſhew'd a manifeſt contempt of all Authority, preſſing now upon the Kings Conſcience, as much as they would have the World to think he had preſs'd upon theirs before; not only refuſing to admit the uſe of the Liturgy (however compos'd by their own Biſhops) in any of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial Churches, but denying the King himſelf the priviledge of having it read in his own private Chappel at <hi>Edenburgh.</hi> And leaſt the World ſhould doubt that their Inſolence was not come to its wiſh'd for height, they took upon them the marks of Soveraign Power, indicting without his Licence or Knowledge, four principal Tables or Counſels in the ſaid Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; one of the Nobility, another of the Gentry, a third of the Burgeſſes, and a fourth of the Miniſtry. Out of which there was ſet up a general Table

               <p>This prov'd ſo much worſe then all that had been before it, in that they were grown more learn'd in the Diſcipline of Daring; and being fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by the Complaints of all that were weary of the Government, or Governours, like the firſt Reformers of <hi>Germany,</hi> they ſum'd up their <hi>Centum Gravamina</hi> in a general Remonſtrance, which was carried on with that unparallel'd Contumacy, that every one that was licentiouſly, inclin'd, pleas'd himſelf with the Imagination of having the Ball of Soveraignty flung down, to be ſcambled for by the Multitude; whoſe Heads being made giddy by the continual Noiſe of thoſe Spiritual Trumpeters, that fill'd their Ears with the joyful ſound of the long look'd for Promiſes of a new Heaven and a new Earth, and the Deſcription of ſuch a Kingdom, wherein (as they ſaid) the Saints and Servants of the moſt High were to reign, by a Special Commiſſion written in the Stars, which none could read but theſe Aſtronomical Rabbins themſelves. They began like men Spiritually drunk, to defie all Carnal Powers, and having before broke the Windows of the Royal Pallace, reſolv'd in the next place to pluck down the two great Pillars of the Throne: Theſe were the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> the one preſiding in Spiritual, t'other in Temporal Matters; both of whom were Impeached of High Treaſon, the one to gratifie their Malice, t'other to ſecure their Fears: the laſt was the firſt brought to ſtake, whoſe Crimes ſavouring rather of Injuſtice to the Subject, then Unfaithfulneſs to the King, proving no otherwiſe Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, but by accumulation of ſo many leſſer Miſdemeanours together as might make up by heap what was wanting in the weight of his Guilt. The King refus'd to condemn him till he had firſt conſulted the Judges in point of Law, and the Biſhops in point of Equity; by either of whom being left in greater doubt (if poſſible) then before, having a natural averſion to all State Phlebotomy, as well knowing that this Blood-letting, though it might ſtop the Feaver for ſome little time, would ſo weaken his Power, that he ſhould not be able to reſiſt any future Diſtemper; the conſideration whereof brought him into a State Convulſion, that drew his Judgment ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral wayes before he could determine what to do. Honour and Juſtice preſs'd him on the one ſide, the Common Intereſt (as 'twas pretended) on which
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:51478:185"/> hung the weight of the Publick, as well as his own private Peace, urg'd him on the other ſide, either grating upon the moſt tender and ſenſible part his Conſcience, which (like a Needle betwixt two Loadſtones, that tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with equal Inclinations to either, at the ſame time ſeems to turn to both, yet neither) was ſo tortur'd between the Conſideration of what was ſafe, and what was Juſt, that it appear'd in bringing the Earl, they had brought him to Tryal, and put him into ſuch an Agony, as ſhook the very Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Government. And this Heſitation of his prov'd to be the Groundwork of three the moſt Important Jealouſies that ever troubled any State, the Parliament thereupon declaring themſelves diſſatisfied in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of their <hi>Religion, Proprieties,</hi> and <hi>Priviledges:</hi> to the clearing whereof they made not long after three as ſtrange <hi>Propoſals:</hi> 1. <hi>For the Extirpation of Biſhops:</hi> 2. <hi>The Eſtabliſhment of a Triennial Parliament:</hi> 3. <hi>The Delivery of the Militia into their Diſpoſal.</hi>

Upon which a Party of Apprentices came down, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the grand Repreſentatives Priſoners in their own Houſe, did (as I may ſay) ram their Vote down their Throats, making them not only retract it, but Vote the Militia back again to the City. Hereupon they call'd for Aid to the Army; and the apprehenſions of what Effects their coming up might have, divided the Common-Councel of <hi>London,</hi> as much as the laſt Riot had thoſe of <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> ſo that the General eaſily entred at the breach, and poſſeſs'd himſelf of the Strength of the City. Now as Maggots are ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by warmth out of Corruption, ſo by the heat of theſe corrupted Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, there was kindled a Generation of Vermin, call'd <hi>Agitators,</hi> which were like the <hi>Locuſts</hi> that roſe out of the ſmoak of the bottomleſs Pit, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> c. 9. v. 3. <hi>to whom</hi> (ſayes the Text) <hi>was given power like as the Scorpions of the Earth have power;</hi> who not liking that the King ſhould continue ſo near as <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> found an expedient to fright him from thence, by muttering ſomething like an intended Aſſaſſina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the diſcovery whereof they knew would quickly be brought to him, and tempt him to make a private Eſcape, knowing well that they had him as a Bird in a ſtring, and could take him again when they pleas'd; which Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel if it had been rejected by him, 'tis probable he had been murther'd in good earneſt: but he flying thereupon to the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> where he was ſecur'd by their faſt Friend the<note n="*" place="margin">Hamen.</note> Governour there, they thought they might adventure to treat with him at that diſtance. Accordingly they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented that the Parliament ſhould tender him theſe four modeſt Propoſitions following, to be reduced into Acts. 1. <hi>That it ſhould be lawful for the Parliament to order and diſpoſe the Militia as they pleas'd for the future, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his conſent; and Treaſon for any to aſſemble in Arms above the number of Thirty, without Commiſſion from them.</hi> 2. <hi>That the Houſes ſhould ſit at what time they pleas'd, and adjourn their ſitting to what place they pleas'd, and meet at their own pleaſure and diſcretion for ever after.</hi> 3. <hi>That all Oaths, Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, and Declarations, ſet forth in Publick by the King againſt either Houſe, ſhould be accompted and declared void.</hi> 4. <hi>That all whom the King had dignified with any Titles, from the time himſelf departed with the Great Seal, ſhould be degraded of their Honour.</hi> Which the <hi>Scotch</hi> Commiſſioners (we muſt remember it to their Honour) thought ſo derogatory to that of the Kings, and contrary to former Ingagements, that they follow'd after the Parliament Commiſſioners with a kind of State Hue and Cry, and proteſted againſt them. I hope it was not all a Juggle (for they had been undone doubtleſs if the King had ſign'd them) but it took effect as they deſired. The King refuſed them, and thereby gave them (as they would have it
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:51478:188"/> thought) juſt cauſe to refuſe him. Whereupon they paſs'd that never to be forgotten Vote of <hi>Non-Addreſſes.</hi> After which the Agitators vaniſh'd and the Committee of <hi>Darby-houſe</hi> took place, which conſiſting moſt of Officers, were now the Plenipotentiaries of the Kingdom. And near the ſame time the Power of <hi>England</hi> was thus given up to them, they had the Reſignation made of that of <hi>Ireland</hi> too.</p>
               <p>The King being now civilly dead, and one would think buried, the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Princes proving (as himſelf obſerv'd) for the moſt part their Graves, the Vote of <hi>Non-Addreſſes</hi> being as Earth flung upon him; For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune cruelly brings him to Life again, by the Cordial of unexpected hopes, heightned by the Zeal of ſeveral Counties declaring for him. Divers Lords in Arms again at Land, and his own Son with others at Sea; theſe incouraged by the Revolt of ſeveral Towns, thoſe by the coming in of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Ships; ſo that there were no leſs then Two thouſand in Arms for him at Sea, with Twenty good Ships, and not ſo litt e as Ten thouſand at Land, with Horſes, Arms, and Ammunition ſuitable. And which was yet more conſiderable, the Grand<note n="*" place="margin">Call'd The Committee of Danger.</note> Committee of State in <hi>Scotland</hi> (whoſe very name carried Danger in it) allarm'd them, by ſending the Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons following; 1. <hi>To bring the King to</hi> London, <hi>or ſome of his Houſes near, with Freedom and Safety.</hi> 2. <hi>To disband the Army.</hi> 3. <hi>To puniſh thoſe that had deteined him in Obſcurity.</hi> 4. <hi>To reſtore the Secluded Members.</hi> 5. <hi>To eſtabliſh the Presbyterian Government, and ſuppreſs Sectaries.</hi> And that they might yet appear more like a Committee of Danger, they ſent a formidable Army under the Conduct of Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> to make good their Demands, and to give their Nation the Honour of being the laſt, as they were the firſt in Arms in this unhappy War.</p>
               <p>The terror of theſe formidable Preparations, incourag'd by ſeveral Petitions out of the City and Country, moved the affrighted Parliament to conſent to a Perſonal Treaty, whilſt the Army was buſie in diſputing the Points with the Sword: and accordingly they recal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Here ſeem'd to be nothing wanting now but a Sword in his hand, to have once more diſputed it with the Sword-men too, and then poſſibly he might have ſaved himſelf and the deſpairing Nation.</p>
               <p>But juſt as every man was making ready to bring in his Peace-Offering, in Confidence that the King and Parliament were fully agreed; the inraged Army, returning home from the Conqueſt of all thoſe that had oppos'd them, doubly dyed with Blood and Treaſon, alike Enemies to Peace and Reaſon, broke down the great Chain of Order, which binds even the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels themſelves, and firſt ſeizing on him, next on them, ſent no leſs then Forty of their principal Members to Hell; a Place purpoſely made their Priſon, not ſo much for any conveniency of Reception, or nearneſs of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, as the Uncoughneſs of the Name, that by the conceipt of being typically damn'd, they might bring them into deſpair, and tempt ſome of them (as after they did) to become their own Executioners: Ninety more they turn'd quite out of the Houſe, and appointed a day for turning out all the reſt. In the mean time they publiſh'd a Modification, which (to make the more acceptable) they term'd <hi>The Agreement of the People,</hi> by
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:51478:189"/> which the number of the Repreſentatives of the Nation was reduc'd to Three hundred, half which were to have power to make a Law; and during the Intervals of Seſſions, a <hi>Councel of State</hi> was to govern: This Model was put into the hands of thoſe Members of their own Faction, who beſides the Confirmation thereof, had Inſtructions given them for paſſing ſix other Votes. 1. <hi>For renewing that of Non-Addreſſes.</hi> 2. <hi>For annulling the Treaty and Conceſſions at the</hi> Iſle of Wight. 3. <hi>For bringing the King to publick Juſtice, to anſwer with his own all the Blood ſhed in the War.</hi> 4. <hi>For ſummoning in his two Sons, the Prince of</hi> Wales <hi>and the Duke of</hi> York, <hi>to render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by a day certain, to give ſatisfaction on their parts, otherwiſe to ſtand exil'd as Traytors to their Country.</hi> 5. <hi>For doing publick Juſtice upon all the Kings Partakers.</hi> 6. <hi>For paying off all their own Arrears forthwith.</hi> How obedient Slaves this Rump of a Houſe were to theſe their own Servants, who could not find in their Heart to pay the leaſt reſpect to their natural Prince, appears by the Sequel: For immediately they gave them (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther permitted them to give themſelves) above Sixty thouſand pounds, and voted that the General ſhould take care to ſecure the King, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of war to draw up a Charge of High Treaſon againſt him.</p>

               <p>And now having brought the Royal Priſoner to their Judgment Seat, they proceed to arraign him with not unlike Impudence and Impiety to that, of the Raſcal Jews, when they brought the King of Kings to Tryal, whom as they charg'd to be a Perverter, ſo theſe charg'd him with being a Subverter of his People; both Priſoners being in this alike Guilty, that eithers Crime was the owning himſelf to be a King; which as the Jews could not indure then, ſo neither could theſe now: Their King thought not fit to give any Anſwer to his Accuſers; this King preparing to give ſitting Anſwers, could not be heard. But he had this ſatisfaction, to hear <hi>Pontius Bradſhaw</hi> the Preſident, by whom he was to be condemn'd, condemn himſelf firſt, and all his Fellow Paricides, by a Reply to him not leſs abſurd then obſervable: For his Majeſty reaſoning upon the unreaſonableneſs of not being ſuffer'd to ſpeak for himſelf, ſaid, <hi>Where is there in all the World that Court in which no Place is left for Reaſon?</hi> to which t'other unwittingly reply'd, <hi>Sir, you ſhall find that this very Court is ſuch an one. Nay then</hi> (retorted the King) <hi>in vain will my Subjects expect Juſtice from you, who ſtop your Ears to your King ready to plead his Cauſe.</hi>

               <p>Thus they ſtrangled him before they beheaded him, and deſigning to murther his Soul (if poſſible) as well as his Body, added to their Denial of Juſtice, ſo many Contumelies, Indignities, and Affronts, as were enough to have tempted him to deſpair, had not his Faith been as ſtrong as his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,

And to aſſure the faithful of the Land that the Rule over them, however it were by a ſingle Perſon, diſſer'd much from Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Monarchy, he did ſo far adventure to deny himſelf, as to admit of thoſe Popular Votes which every Body thought were ſo incompatible with all Kingly Principles, that it was impoſſible for any one ever to cheat them into Allegiance again: As 1. <hi>That the People under God are the Original of all juſt Power.</hi> 2. <hi>That the Commons of</hi> England <hi>in Parliament aſſembled, being choſen by, and repreſenting the People, have the Supream Authority of this Nation.</hi> 3. <hi>That whatſoever is enacted by them, and declar'd for Law, hath the force of Law.</hi> 4. <hi>That all the People of this Nation were concluded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, although the conſent and concurrence of the King and Houſe of Peers were not had thereto.</hi> But long it was not ere he extracted out of the dreggs of theſe Votes certain Spirits that made thoſe about him ſo drunk with Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and Courage, that they forgat all their Republican Reſolves; and as 'tis ſaid that <hi>Caeſar</hi> incouraged the fearful Pilot that was to waft him over Sea in a Storm, by only telling him he carried <hi>Caeſar</hi> and his Fortunes: ſo they were animated by the confidence they obſerv'd in him, who on the ſudden was exalted to that wonderful pitch of boldneſs, as altered his very Countenance, &amp; made it not much unlike that of<note n="*" place="margin">Sutton.

                  <hi>Lucius Domitius</hi> the great Anceſtor of the <hi>Aenobarbi,</hi> whoſe face being ſtroked by two <hi>Cluii</hi> or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar <hi>Damons,</hi> is ſaid to have been transformed into a kind of Copper-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. And having to that brazen face of his ſuch an Iron heart as deem'd nothing too difficult for him to attempt, they were eaſily perſwaded to joyn themſelves with him, whiles he threw himſelf upon dangers ſeemingly invincible; ſo ſeemingly unconcern'd, as if he had known, or at leaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that he earrled the Fate of the three Nations upon the point of his ſingle Sword: So that it is no marvel, after a long Series of Succeſſes, both in <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> where his very name (like that of <hi>Caeſars</hi>) made his way to Victory, having at the laſt got the better of the King himſelf, in the fatal Battel of <hi>Worceſter</hi> (whom yet with a Politick Modeſty he denied to have been defeated by his, but (as he ſaid) by an Arm from Heaven) he ſhould be ſo hardy as with the ſame Club he wreſted out of <hi>Hercules</hi> hand, to daſh out the Brains of the Infant Common-wealth (not then full five years old) making himſelf the ſole Adminiſtrator of all its Goods and Chattels; to wit, the Moneys raiſed by ſale of Crown and Church Lands, the growing benefit of all Forfeitures, Confiſcations, and Compoſitions, together with the annual Rent of Ninety thouſand pounds <hi>per menſem;</hi> over and beſides which he had advantage of all the queint Projections then on foot, as the years rent laid on Houſes built upon new Foundations in and about <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> the Contributions for the diſtreſſed Proteſtants in <hi>Savoy,</hi> the Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Committee of Propagation (as 'twas call'd) who were to take care for the planting the Goſpel in the dark Parts of the World, being no inconſiderable Levies. Theſe I take to have been the perſonal Eſtate of the Common-wealth: To the real Eſtate of Inheritance (which he princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally aim'd at) <hi>viz.</hi> the Soveraignty and Dominion of the three Kingdoms by Sea and Land, ſince he could make no better Title then as the firſt Occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant by his Primier Seiſin, which in effect was none other but plain Diſſeiſm, ſo long as the right Heir was alive, againſt whom there could be no bar by Fine or Recovery, whilſt he continued beyond the Seas; the Learned Knaves about him adviſed him to intitle himſelf to it by Act of Parliament: Now foraſmuch as by the firſt Inſtrument of Government, it was Articled
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:51478:191"/> that there ſhould be a Parliament once in three years, two whereof he had already call'd, that had neither pleas'd him, nor were pleas'd with him (the firſt being ſo bold to queſtion his Authority, the next himſelf) he reſolv'd now to appear like the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> with his Baſhaws about him; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he choſe ſeveral Prefects of Provinces, whom he call'd by the name of <hi>Major Generals,</hi> whoſe buſineſs it was firſt to keep down the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable Cavaliers; ſecondly, to new mould the Linſey-wolſey Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters, many of whom about this time began to be corrupted with Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Honeſty; and laſtly, to reform the Elections of Burgeſſes, ſo that he might with no leſs ſatisfaction then ſafety call (as a little after he did) the third Parliament, whom yet he vouchſafed not the honour of that Name: but to ſhew them how little he feared any Battery of their Ordinance, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them to be nick-nam'd <hi>The Convention,</hi> a ſtrange Pack, made up on purpoſe for the ſtrange Game he was to play, of all Knaves; but Knaves, as it appear'd afterward, of different Complections. Theſe having fram'd another Inſtrument of Government,<note place="margin">Indeavours to make the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector King.</note> preſſed him by their <hi>humble Petition and Advice,</hi> as they term'd it, with not unlike flattery and falſhood as <hi>M. Anthony</hi> did <hi>Caeſar,</hi> to legitimate his Uſurpation by taking upon him the Title of <hi>King.</hi> The Lawyers that were of his Common-Council, urg'd him to it, for that (as they ſaid) there was no other way left for him to guard the Laws, or for the Laws to guard him. The States-men that were of his Privy-Councel, provok'd him to it, by the Example of <hi>Brutus</hi> the Roman Libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, whoſe folly (they ſaid) it was, that having murther'd <hi>Caeſar,</hi> he did not ſet up himſelf, or ſome other, King, though by ſome other name: ſince, as he could not be ignorant, that ſuch abortive Liberty as he had given life to, muſt needs prove the Parent of a laſting ſervitude; ſo he might foreſee, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> had ſo ingrafted himſelf into the Body Politick, that one could not be ſeparate from the other, without the deſtruction of both: and as he had need of Forces, ſo had they of a Head, and better one craz'd then none at all. His neareſt Friends and Relations preſs'd him upon the point of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: Neither could there be a readier Argument to perſwade him to take upon him to be a Prince, then to tell him he was deſcended from Princes: For who knew not that his great Anceſtor <hi>Cradoc Vraych Vras,</hi> Earl of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix,</hi> having (as the Herauld ſaid) married the Princeſs <hi>Tegaire,</hi> Daughter and Heir of <hi>Pelinor</hi> King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> many hundred of years before either the <hi>Norman</hi> or <hi>Saxon</hi> Conquerors could pretend to any thing: ſo that now the Queſtion was not ſo much with what right he could make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf King of <hi>England,</hi> as by what right he had been ſo long kept out of it.</p>
               <p>In this confuſion of Counſels, it came to his own turn at laſt to adviſe himſelf, and accordingly he weighed all their Arguments, and taking the laſt firſt into conſideration, he eaſily over-paſs'd the honour of his Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, for two Reaſons: Firſt, for that his was not the chief Family of <hi>Wales:</hi> and ſecondly, for that he was not the Chief of his Family. Beſides, common Fame had debas'd him, by an odd kind of Diſparagement, which (however perhaps miſtaken) took much from the dignity of his Perſon, as being believ'd to have been an ordinary Brewer: though it prov'd to be (as <hi>Daniel</hi> obſerves by <hi>Jaques D' Artevile,</hi> the great Stickler of <hi>Flanders</hi> in <hi>Edward</hi> the Third his time) a Brewer of more then of Beer. Neither did he much more regard the point of Law, for that he knew it to be no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe binding then as a ſilken Cord, which upon any force uſed to it, is apt to flip and let go its hold. That which mov'd him moſt was the point of State, rais'd out of that pinching Preſident of <hi>Brutus;</hi> yet there was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable ſcruple reſted upon that too, to wit, How it could be reaſonable
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:51478:192"/> for him to expect to hold them in with a twine thread of voluntary Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, who had ſo lately by his own advice broken the ſtrong bond of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance; and (which yet he durſt not object to any but himſelf) he foreſaw his Death would make way for ſome of his Fellow Regicides, to uſurp (by his own Example) as much upon his Succeſſors, to the diſſeiſin of thoſe who call'd him Father, as he had done, by diſinheriting the Sons of the true Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his Country. This ſhewing him, that the thing call'd Chance would have its ſhare, in deſpight of all his wiſdom and providence, and that there was unknown danger attended that unknown Chance, he retreated into his firſt diſguiſe, acting over the diſſembling part of<note n="*" place="margin">Who ſo reads <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Speech at diſſolving the Convention, <hi>Jan. 1657</hi> will find this paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel of <hi>Tiberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> very proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apply'd to him.</note>

               <p>To ſay truth, he was afraid of thoſe only, by whom only he us'd to make others afraid, his emulous Baſhaws, thoſe mighty men of War before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd, who wheeling about, declar'd againſt all Monarchy on Earth, but that of Jeſus Chriſt, under whom they thought themſelves as well entituled to be Major Generals, as under him.
